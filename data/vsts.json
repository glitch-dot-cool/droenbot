Real-time swapping between components of 33 sound sources. 97 special pre-analyzed sound sources included. 3 ADSRs, 3 synchronizable LFOs, global pitch LFO. Modulation section with Stereo Delay and Flanger effects. Up to 64 voices, 300 presets included. All parameters accessible via MIDI controller. \nNOTE: Plex 1 was distributed by Steinberg as a commercial product.\n",

Areas of interest are sound design, algorithmic composition, DSP, electronic/computer music and education. CPS can be used in any realtime situation where sound plays a role. \nBuild-in objects allow you low-level access to audio MIDI and other I/O, and any processing in between. Objects include audio and MIDI (hardware&file) I/O, fourier analyse, filters, noise generators, envelopes, delays, LFOs, effects, and much more objects like tables which you can fill with 'generators' (a feature which derives directly from Csound), several network options, joystick, serialport, video processing units (through Quicktime) for layered playback of video & images, VST hosting of VST plugins/instruments, MP3 decoding, and all MPEG-4 Structured Audio opcodes (which are on their turn based on Csound). The best of as well graphic and text editing comes together inside CPS. There is a list of all objects in the manual. \nCPS is not only a realtime toolkit; it is also a friendly graphical user environment. CPS has a subpatch architecture (of unlimited depth), with which you can put parts of you patch within one object. Furthermore, objects in CPS have a dynamic number of in- and outputs at runtime. Of course, it has full Undo/Redo, all objects have tooltips (including subpatches) and online help, working with subpatches does not slow down your patch, etc. \n",

Unison, mix, and tone controls are also available. LFO Controls - This is just a standard LFO with various destinations. Rogue's LFO features a delay, that allows you to \"fade-in\" the LFO's effect. Lowpass Filter Controls - A standard low pass filter with resonance. Assignable Envelope Controls - The assignable envelope can be routed to nearly any of Rogue's other controls via its dual destination slots. It also features a unique \"Step Mode\" that creates varying levels of hard stepping through the envelope's range. MIDI/Modulation Controls - Allows you to enable the accent control and envelope retrigger, adjust the accent amount, set the bend range, glide time, and modulation amount/source/destination. Features dual destination slots and enable controls. Distortion/Master Controls - Rogue's unique distortion controls and final tone/volume controls. \n\n",

Ultradia is broken into two 45-minute phases that gently but powerfully oscillate through the active and rest phases of a complete ultradian rhythm. \nUltradia SE is a VSTi for creating binaural beat brainwave entrainment tones. Created by Hockinfinger based on the original concept provided by Dr. Diane Kistner. \nThere are two tones created by this VSTi. The carrier tone is produced in the left channel.The right channel will be the sum frequency of the carrier tone and the frequency selected for brainwave entrainment. The tones are triggered by any MIDI note, and volume is controlled by MIDI volume controller #7. The tones can be selected via MIDI controllers 14 & 15. \n\n",

Values of each oscillator's parameters continually change, equating to movement through five-dimensional hyperspace. Movement through hyperspace is constrained to a bounding box specified by a home position and permissive range for each parameter. Graphical envelopes modify the bounding box through the duration of each note. Within the bounding box, each oscillator follows a rule-based flocking algorithm - a 5D equivalent of AI simulations of 2D and 3D animal flocking behaviour. 3D visualisation of the oscillator's movement through hyperspace, using hue & luminance to represent the other 2 dimensions. Mouse-clicking the hyperspace visualisation affects the sound by causing oscillators to veer towards or away from the mouse. Hotkey powered sticky-mouse for moving the cursor in 5 dimensions. Controllable reseeding to make the algorithm deterministic or non-deterministic. 100 automatable parameters, controllable through VST automation or fully remappable MIDI control messages.

    "description": "Powershaper is a saturation, distortion and overdrive effect plugin for professional music production applications. Powershaper's approach to saturation is unique as it works in multi-stage manner utilizing dozens of saturation stages in a specified variation. While Powershaper was designed to apply extreme saturation, it can be also used to boost presence of audio tracks subtly.\nThe flexibility of this saturation plug-in is most apparent when applying saturation to the drums: it is possible to dial settings that retain or even extend the punch while applying strong pleasant coloration and presence effect.\nPowershaper can be used to apply saturation with good results to various sounds: vocals, drums, bass, guitars, synths, mixes:\n Powershaper features: Multi-stage algorithm. Algorithm variations. Stereo processing. Preset manager. Undo/redo history. A/B comparisons. Contextual hint messages. All sample rates support. Zero processing latency. User interface color schemes. Resizable interface. Retina and HighDPI support. \n",

    "description": "Virtual Studio Technology (VST) is developed by Steinberg and first launched in 1996. The SDK/API is freely available to all.\nVST creates a full, professional studio environment on your PC or Mac. VST allows the integration of virtual effect processors and instruments into your digital audio environment. These can be software recreations of hardware effect units and instruments or new creative effect components in your VST system. All are integrated seamlessly into VST compatible host applications. These VST modules have the sound quality of the best hardware units, yet are far more flexible. All functions of a VST effect processor or instrument are directly controllable and automatable; either with a mouse or with an external hardware controller. VST also allows easy integration of external equipment, allowing you to put together a system tailor-made to your needs.\nBeing an open standard, the possibilities offered by VST have steadily been growing over the past decade. New virtual effect processors and virtual instruments are constantly being developed.\n\nVST 3 is a general rework of the long-serving VST Plug-in interface. It is not compatible with the older VST versions, but it includes some new features and possibilities. We have redesigned the API to make it not only far easier and more reliable for developers to work with, but have also provided completely new possibilities for Plug-ins. These include:\n Improved Performance with the Silence Flag \nProcessing can optionally be applied to Plug-ins only when audio signals are present on their respective inputs, so VST 3 Plug-ins can apply their processing economically and only when it is needed:\n Multiple Dynamic I/Os \nVST 3 Plug-ins are no longer limited to a fixed number of inputs and outputs, and their I/O configuration can dynamically adapt to the channel configuration. Side-chains are also very easily realizable. This includes the possibility to deactivate unused buses after loading and even reactivate those when needed. This cleans up the mixer and further helps to reduce CPU load:\n Sample-accurate automation \nVST 3 also features vastly improved parameter automation with sample accuracy and support for ramped automation data, allowing completely accurate and rapid parameter automation changes:\n Logical Parameter Organization \nThe Plug-in parameters are displayed in a tree structure. Parameters are grouped into sections which represent the structure of the Plug-in. Plug-ins can communicate their internal structure for the purpose of overview, but also for some associated functionality (e.g. program-lists):\n Resizeable UI editor \nVST 3 defines a way to allow resizing of the Plug-in editor by a user:\n Note Expression \nVST 3 defines with Note Expression a new way of event controller editing. The Plug-in is able to break free from the limitations of MIDI controller events by providing access to new VST 3 controller events that circumvent the laws of MIDI and provide articulation information for each individual note (event) in a polyphonic arrangement according to its noteId:\n Factory Concept \nVST 3 Plug-in library could export multiple Plug-ins and in this way replaces the shell concept of VST 2 (kPlugCategShell).\nVST is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH, registered in Europe and other countries.\n",

Transposing to lower octaves produces a bigger and less resonant sound similar to traditional reverbs, while in turn transposing to higher octaves produces a very bright harp-like effect. \n",

Filter Section: Making use of David Haupt's Multi-filter module complete with gain compensation, and multiple stages (up to 8 stages, careful when using high resonance in the high stages, can produce extreme loudness). Following the filter is a subtle distortion for beefing up the sound. The filter has its own sequencer for modulating the cutoff frequency.  Delay Section: Stereo delay section with dual sequencer for modulating the delay rate and feedback. The delay has left and right panners for spreading out the delay.  Each effect section can be turned on/off. Each effect section has its own hidden panel for extra options. Each sequencer can be paused, switch direction and change speed. Shifter and filter sequencers have glide controls for gliding the modulation between steps. \n\n",

This XL version supposes a complete rewrite of the old Elottronix, and adds a ton of new possibilities: \n Two independent routable delay lines, with a maximum delay time of 80 seconds. Tempo can be synced to host BPM. LFO controlled Pan per delay line, with definable Bar Divisions, Pitch and Waveform. Two global Pan modes: normal and inverted. Rehearsal option: when switched ON, the incoming signal doesn't pass through the delay lines, so you can try different things before inserting them into the loop. Biquad-X multimode filter per delay line. This advanced filter has 9 different modes: Low Pass, High Pass, Low Shelf, High Shelf, All Pass, Band Reject, Band Pass CSG, Band PassC0PK and Peak. Optional parameters to control are Gain, Cutoff and Q. Tape machine: this module generates tape hiss, which can be pitched up and down. Completely automatable via MIDI CC. Moderate CPU use (-8% Athlon XP 2400+). Includes 8 Presets to give an idea of the effect (4 for sends, 4 for inserts). But what Elottronix XL does can't be covered with presets as you'll discover. \n\n",

Impulse-responses are generated by recording short, broadband signals and their corresponding room-reflections, and by cutting out the initial signal. What is left contains the information needed to reproduce the same room with other signals.\nFeatures:\nWorks with a fixed latency of 8960 samples (possibly compensated by VST-Host). You can adjust predelay, attack-time, length and stereo width of the impulse response. Stretch (up & downsampling of impulse response). FFT EQ (to adjust the frequency spectrum of the impulse-response). Auto Gain (automatic volume compensation). Dynamic CPU Consumption (use only the CPU power that is needed to get the result). \n",

    "description": "SB - 101 is a mono/poly one osc synth designed for bass and lead sounds. \nThe oscillator can be used on its own for sine, saw, ramp, pulse, and noise waveforms, or as the carrier for frequency modulation and phase modulation synthesis. Sync can also be employed from the modulator to the carrier, for the phase sync sound or for more unusual effects. \nAn ADSR envelope generator routes in either positive or negative variable levels to filter and pitch, as well as controlling the amplitude. An LFO, with several wave shapes, also is routable in positive or negative amounts to filter cutoff, filter resonance, envelope decay rate, and to the width of the pulse wave in the oscillator section. \nA classic style arpeggiator is also present, as well as glide and retrigger controls. Glide can be applied to the arpeggio, using an extended gate length. Finally, there is a built in simple delay. \nUnusual options on this instrument are: A separate output for the delay signal, which can be turned on in multi-channel hosts in order to have separate eq and FX for dry and effected output; and the ability to set a different midi channel for the arpeggiator for triggering it separately from the regular notes. \n\n",

    "description": "Rez is a seemingly basic synth, but it's capable of a very wide range of sounds. While Rez has a bunch of cool features, the beating heart of Rez is its filter. It's made from multiple chained filters acting as a single powerful filter and it's highly resonant, providing Rez with its distinctive character. Top that off with distortion, a phaser, various oscillator modulations, delay, and a killer programmable arp and step sequencer, and you've got a powerhouse of a synth in a very small package.\nFrom funky squishes, beastly basses, and screaming leads, to tight arpeggiations, swirling rhythms, atmospheres, bells, and interesting effects, you'll find it all here. Additionally, it comes with two skins - Yellow & Black, or Black & Yellow.\nFeatures:\nVirtual analog oscillators. Sub-oscillator. Detune (modulatable via aftertouch). Programmable phrase arpeggiator. Step sequencer (arp driven) with four mod destinations. Highly resonant low pass filter with velocity, LFO, and envelope modulation. \"Age\" control (noise to pitch). Two types of phase modulation. Beastly overdrive with three tone modes. Dual delay with stereo width adjustment. Phaser with optional LFO and velocity modulation. MIDI learn for all controls. \n\n",

In addition to the main plugin (Nokia Audio Suite 2.0) with complete feature set, the package contains two other software products (Auralisation tool and The Lights Editor) for more limited tasks only. \nVST Audio plug-ins Nokia Audio Suite 2.0 is an authoring tool designed for use by audio professionals who create audio content for mobile devices. More specifically, NAS 2.0 allows its user to monitor, analyze, create, and edit the SP-MIDI, MobileDLS and MobileXMF format types of audio content. Lights Simulation and editor, a feature of NAS 2.0, can be used to create content for and simulate the Nokia Lights Feature enabled phones. \nAuralisation tool plug-in auralises (or models) the audio content the way it would sound when played through the speaker of a mobile device taking into account physical properties of the mobile device (such as cover, hardware components used). Note that there may be differences between PC speakers. \nStandalone program The Lights Editor is an application for creating and editing Lights Configurations within MIDI files. \nFeatures of the Nokia Audio Suite 2.0: \nCreation and editing of SP-MIDI, mobile XMF and mobile DLS files, including a WAV-editor. Project tree with the copy / paste of data from one audio-file to another allows fast development of multiple music files. The possibility for playback of (edited) mobile audio files in the plugin itself, without export. Combined use of a Nokia's phone's sound bank and auralisation profile. Includes two original synthesizers used in Nokia phones for playback. Integrated environment for editing and simulating midi lights data. Project file written in the XMF-format. Vibra activity indicator. Supported Nokia phone models: 2650, 3100, 3200, 3220, 3230, 3300, 3510, 3510i, 3650, 5100, 5140, 6020, 6100, 6170, 6220, 6230, 6230i, 6260, 6600, 6610, 6630, 6650, 6670, 6800, 6820, 7200, 7210, 7250, 7270, 7600, 7610, 7650, 7710, 9300, 9500, N-Gage, N-GageQD. \n",

Imagine pulling a drummer up front or pushing him to the background by dragging just a single slider. Feel like moving the walls around him? Again, a single push enhances the room information or can make the sound really dry. Saturation stage. Following digitalfishphones tradition, the plugin can help to reduce harshness often associated with digital recordings, giving back some warmth and life to your source by modeling classic analog equipment. The tonal character stays adjustable within a broad range. High frequency details section. Similar to classic exciter circuits, this section allows you to brighten up a signal, giving transparency and depth by generating additional harmonics. Non-clipping output stage. Like the endorphin compressor, a brickwall waveshaper circuit ensures that the output won't exceed -0.1dBFS, while remaining sonically clean. \n",

    "description": "Ever heard of the denormalisation problem? \nUpgraded to a P4 processor and got problems with load spikes like never before?. Does a certain plugin consume all available CPU power whenever there's NO signal coming in (or out)?. \nDenormalisation is an issue with some audio hosts that don't switch off the plugin's audio task when the song is stopped or a track contains silence (or with instruments: no key is pressed while a sound decays). \nThe problem happens when the CPU (precisely: the floating point unit (FPU) inside of it) detects extremely small numbers and wishes to process them with the same precision as usual. Then it switches into 'denormal' mode which is another way of representing small floating point numbers with the available bit range. Converting between the two states takes a lot of time for the FPU and thus might cause heavy load jumps. \nSome algorithm such as delay lines and filters are prone to denormalisation as they work with feedback structures. Here, if an impulse is followed by absolute silence, the resulting signal gets smaller and smaller but in theory, it can never reach zero. In practice, there is an internal threshold of the FPU that switches to denormal mode to carry on processing those small numbers (which might not be of any use for proper operation). \nNormalizer is a small plugin that should cancel out those numbers and ensure a trouble-free sequencing of your songs. \n",

The time constants stay manually set, but they are also affected by the signal's energy. This mode has the typical opto-style 'overshoot' on quick transients, this is one of the most gentle compressors you may find. Classical feed-back detector circuit.  Adjustable high-level output stage with analog-style saturation. Global 'de-comp/sat' section.

The lattice filter can be of any order from 1 to 80 and uses reflection coefficients extracted from an image. This output is fed through a saturation stage and a ducking / limiting stage before being fed back, again, into the delay lines. The lattice filter is warped, and by adjusting the warping parameter its frequency response can be easily adjusted. \nResonance controls the distance between spectral peaks and spectral valleys in the filter transfer function, and cutoff controls the cutoff of a first-order low pass filter that follows the lattice filter. \n",

Within the soundfield there is - of course - the listeners head, which is simulated with a 512 Tap HRTF-Convolver (FIR-Filter). This causes high CPU-Load (about 50% @2GHz, but improvements are on the way). \nThe plugin gives you the ability to mix your quadraphonic music, without using 4 loudspeakers.

With the advanced capabilities offered by VSTi, USB/HID, MIDI and DirectShow you could conceivably play your favorite video soundtrack through a plugin adjusted by a glove controller.\nWith ABox2, editing virtual circuitry has never been easier. Get objects from the palette, put them where you want, connect them however you like. Adjust parameters using one click popup panels then move on. No questions asked. Make a mistake ? Hit Undo, all fixed. Like that section of circuitry ? Clone it, now you have another one. Really like that section of circuitry ? Group it together, create a new object.

Microtonal capabilities with any scale, any number of notes per octave (up to 127) and keymapping. 3 synthesizer engines:  ADsynth\" or \"ADnote\" is a complex engine which makes sounds by adding a number of voices. Each one has filters, envelopes, LFOs, morphing, modulation (Ring Modulation, Phase Modulation, the modulators can have any shape), resonance, etc. Each voice includes a very powerful waveform generator with up to 128 sine/nonsine harmonics. This engine includes antialiasing. \"SUBsynth\" or \"SUBnote\" is a simpler engine which allows you to make sounds by subtraction of harmonics of sounds from white noise. \"PADsynth\" or \"PADnote\") makes beautiful pads and other instruments.   Instruments can be organized in kits, which allows you to make drum kits or layered (mixed) instruments; this makes it possible to use more than one instrument for a single part. It is possible to choose what items from the kit should be processed by the Part's effects. Effects: Reverb, Echo, Chorus/Flange, Phaser, AlienWah (a kind of vocal morpher), Distortion (Waveshaping), EQ, DynamicFilter. The effects can behave as System Effects or as Insert Effects; this allows you to use many effects at the same time. You can put any insert effect on any part (or more insert effects to same parts, if you like) or you can put the insert effect to Master output. Also, you can have instrument's effect (that is saved with the instrument). Filters up to 60dB/octave (or more); filters can be analogue (LPF,HPF, BPF,etc.), formant (advanced formant filters) and state variable (SVF). Envelopes can have ADSR (or ASR, etc.) modes or can be free modes (with any shape). Many settings have a \"randomness\" option; this produces a very pleasant effect (like analogue synths or natural instruments that can't produces exactly same sound twice). Intuitive and easy to use User Interface. MIDI support (supports many controllers) and (if you want) JACK support. Virtual Keyboard.

    "description": "Shortcircuit was created as a reaction against the ongoing trend where software samplers are being designed with the primary intent of library playback. It is intended for people who consider a sampler to be a musical instrument in its own right, and not just a way to emulate other instruments. High priority was given to ensuring that adding and editing individual samples is as fast and logical as possible.\nThe sample hierarchy in shortcircuit allow you to place samples directly at the highest level of the multi, without having to deal with instrument hierarchies and patches. Want to add a sample to your song? Just drag & drop the sample into shortcircuit and you're ready to go. Samples can be put in groups for multi-sampling and kit-building, but the complexity is only there when you need it.\nSound quality is of highest concern, and shortcircuit uses very high-quality interpolation to ensure that your samples sound as good as the source material, regardless of the pitch you play them at. All filters & effects are calculated at the precision required for them to sound the way intended and oversampling are used when required to prevent aliasing.\nEach voice in shortcircuit features two filter-slots, and the selection isn't limited to the traditional pick. In addition to the regular lowpass / highpass / bandpass / notch & peak-filters and variations thereof there is an array of filter algorithms (not strictly filters in the traditional sense, but called so because of their location in the audio path) including distortion, parametric / graphic / morphing equalizers, bit-reduction / decimation, gating, limiting, slew-rate distortion, ring-modulation, frequency shifting and phase-modulation (better known as FM). The selection even includes analog-style oscillators that you can mix with the sample. \nSpecifications\nUser interface:\n Streamlined user interface for fast editing at the sample-zone level. Fast editing of multiple zones. \"In context\"-sample preview. Extensive drag & drop support (onto the keyrange-view or the list-view). \n RIFF wave-files (.wav) (8/16/24/32-bit & 32-bit float, mono/stereo at any sample rate). AKAI S5000/S6000/Z4/Z8 .akp banks (partial). NI battery kits (partial). Soundfont 2.00 (partial). Propellerheads Recycle 1 & 2. \n High-quality sinc interpolation. Oversampling used when needed to prevent aliasing. Double-precision float math (64-bit) used where it matters (IIR-filters). Single-precision float math (32-bit) used elsewhere. Supports any sample-rate. Max polyphony per instance: 256 voices  Multiple outputs (max 16 mono AND 8 stereo-pairs per instance). Supported sample-playback modes:   Forward  Forward loop  Forward loop with crossfading  Forward loop until release  Forward loop bidirectional   Forward shot  Sliced (maps slices across the keyboard)  On release  Reverse  Reverse shot    2 filters / voice.

The sound can then be further processed by a number of crude \"effects.\" \nThough it is based on the same concept as the original, Mr. Alias 2 is completely rewritten for cross-platform compatibility, and has a number of significant improvements. \nSome highlights: \n2 oscillators. 18 waveforms. Full stereo processing. 6 filter types including a formant filter. Filter envelope. External audio processing. Patch randomizer button. Highly configurable MIDI control with MIDI learn. MIDI-controllable patch morphing. Drag & drop preset and MIDI map loading. Resizable GUI. \n",

In addition, two separate low pass filters are after the output stage of channels 1/3 2/4 respectively. All sound processing & signal generation is connected to the master LFO network (parameter blast-m). The LFO network makes it easy to modulate any key parameter without using external MIDI controller modulation. However, all of ABV4 Sophia's parameters are controllable via MIDI control change messages. \n\n",

    "description": "Jack OS X is a Mac OS X implementation of the Jack Audio Connection Kit (Jack). Jack is a low-latency audio server, written originally for the GNU/Linux operating system. It connects any number of different applications to a single hardware audio device; it also allows applications to send and receive audio to and from each other. Jack focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients, and low latency operation.\nJack OS X installs everything necessary to take full advantage of Jack on OS X. This includes:\nThe Jack server The infrastructure you need in place to use Jack. The Jack Audio Server (JAS) JAS is a CoreAudio \"user space\" driver that allows any OS X CoreAudio application to become a Jack client. The Jack audio plugins Both AU and VST \"Jack-aware\" audio plugins are provided, which can further expand the limitless audio routing possibilities when using Jack. Both VST formats (Mach-O and CFM) are provided. The JackPilot application JackPilot offers an easy to use GUI interface that allows you to control the Jack server, and manage the audio connections between applications and/or plugins. \n",

It can be used by plugin developers for debugging and as a quality control tool, since it can work with virtually any sample rate and any VST Host settings. Furthermore several automated tests are included.\nA simple interface makes it easy to use for anyone. Predefined measurements allow to measure the impulse response and thus the magnitude and phase response of any VST effect plugin. Different excitation signals also allow to get an overview how non-linearities affect the impulse response. For further nonlinear investigations, a dedicated waveshaper measurement is available. Beside that, a complete suite of unique measurements for dynamics (compressor/limiters) is available.\nThe measurement results can be saved in several formats. Impulse responses, can be saved as WAV or CSV (for import in to Excel). All plots can be stored as Bitmap/PNG or SVG (only available on request). Furthermore it is possible to copy the measured data to MATLAB for further processing.\nSpecifications:\nFully customisable VST host. Can work faster than real time, allowing to present results instantly. Works virtually with any given sample rate. Every VST parameter is adjustable without using the GUI. Several built-in measurements such as: Impulse Response Measurement (including magnitude and phase response). Harmonic Distortion (including THD, THD+N values). CPU Performance Test (including P4-bug check). Harmonic Response (fast frequency response measurement of K2, K3...). Waveshaper measurement. Several dynamic measurements (e.g. static characteristic, attack/release time, etc.). Built-in generator for white and pink noise. Workbench for virtually every test available (on request).  Plots can be saved as WAV, CSV, BMP/PNG and SVG (on request). Special KVR export available to produce graphics optimized for the KVR-Forum. Data can be transferred to MATLAB for further processing.  (Last) settings are stored in an INI file. \n",

Effect or VSTi can be distributed to be tested in a temporary directory without the need of the presence of another host or to search for a dedicated VSTPlugIns-subdirectory. The VSTi-dll can still be used within other hosts like Cubase, Sonar etc. when copied to that host's VSTPlugins-subdirectory. \nFor use just rename SAVIHost.exe to the corresponding VSTi.dll e.g. if there is abc123.dll rename SAVIHost.exe to abc123.exe and this will run the VSTi.\nSeparate versions for VST 2, VST Module Architecture, and VST3 are available in 32- and 64-bit versions.\n",

Because of this, the GUI features a peak display showing the maximum peak output level. The peak display is reset by clicking on it.\nHigh-pass filters are especially useful for removing unwanted or inaudible bass frequencies. In a mix, you usually want the bass to come from one or two specific tracks. Removing the bass from the other tracks can make mixing easier and help eliminate \"mud\" from the final mix.\n",

    "description": "Latency Fixer is a free plug-in that reports to the host application that it has a latency (controlled by the plug-in parameters) but does not actually apply any processing to the audio signal. This causes the host to use its own latency compensation to advance the audio fed into the plug-in by the requested amount.\n This is useful to compensate for e.g. routing audio via outboard effect processors, where the audio's journey out of your audio interface and back in to the computer introduces a latency into the signal. For example you may find it useful in conjunction with Logic's Helper->I/O plug-in.\n For it to work, the host application must support 'plug-in delay compensation' and the feature must be turned on.\n",

You can also adjust the master volume and the bender range (from 1 to 12 semitones) and the portamento time. \n\n",

This signal is then added back to the original, for effects ranging from a subtle livening of dead sources, to trashy thrash.\nFloFi has 5 controls:\nFREQ - The source frequency that will be shifted up by an octave.WIDTH - The width of the frequency band being shifted. BOOST - The amount of level boost applied to the pitched signal. A limiter works to prevent unmusical digital distortion. DETUNE - The signal being shifted can be detuned by approximately +/- 2.5 semitones. MIX - The amount of the pitch-shifted and altered signal to be mixed back into the original.\n",

Use it as a send in hosts that do not provide proper sends, or for feedback loops in modular hosts that do not support them. \nNOTE: Uses the host's default GUI. \nThere are two versions of the DLL included: Original and Simplified.\nOriginalThis has the same parameter map as the original Delphi version (Now C++). it should be completely compatible across projects using the Delphi version (1.05 BETA). There is also a bug fix which resolves audio that could get stuck in the channel buffer when switching channel during playback (creating a buzzing noise). It opens up one new possibility - you can now automate the channel parameter to stream audio to different sends.\nSimplifiedThis version only has two parameters. Mode (Send/Return), and Amount (% signal to send). You should take the simplified version DLL and rename it something like send1.dll. You can make copies of the DLL for each additional send/return you'd like to have available. For example: send1, send2, send3, send4. Each DLL can then only communicate to an identically named DLL. This eliminates the need to use the channels in the original version. It also gives you a nice visual cue.\n",

It can be used on individual instruments, across aux busses, or even as a mastering effect. Its fine-tuned, \"smooth as buttah\" sidechain and specialized release shapes make it equally at home with vocals, drums, guitars and full mixes. Use it sparingly for subtle, transparent \"tightening\"; or drive it hard and fast for deep, \"balls-to-the-walls\" pumping. \n The Vanilla Compressor is currently in the alpha stage, and is free to download and evaluate. After development is completed, the final release will be available for purchase for US$50. \n Features: \nThreshold: -40dB to 0dB in 0.1dB increments. Ratio: 1:1 (no compression) to 20:1 (limiting). Soft-knee: 0dB (linear/\"hard knee\") to 12dB (nonlinear/\"soft knee\") in 0.5dB steps. Max Make-up: Maximizes the output gain to 0dB, such that it is proportional to the threshold and ratio parameters. Compressor Output: -40dB to +40dB in 0.1dB increments. Attack. Release. Release Shape: Smooth, Pump, ARC-1 & ARC-2 (Auto Release Control). Key Input  (for sidechain). Detection: Peak and RMS. SideChain Filter: Let the compressor react to certain frequencies, while ignoring others. Off, Low, High and Band settings. Frequency: Cutoff frequency for the sidechain filter (60Hz to 6kHz). Listen: Listen to the sidechain (control) signal at the output of the filter, before it is rectified/averaged. Mix: Wet/Dry mix. Output: -40dB to +40dB in 0.1dB increments. Limiter. \n The Vanilla Compressor uses RMS power summing for stereo linking, to maintain an accurate image of stereo signals. \n",

Oscillator) Gives a large stacked oscillator sound, variable between Sawtooth, Square Wave and Triangle. Width control used to detune stack and Orch selectors used to give various degrees of octave spans. Oscillator 2: (Morph Oscillator) Provides 5 basic waveforms (including noise), these are then constantly variable using the Morph and Shape controls to mutate the waveforms into more harmonically rich structures. Osc 2 can be synced to Oscillator 1 and can be detuned in fine amounts or using the note indicator provided. Autobend: can provide a sweep up in note or a sweep down in note at each key event or each trigger pulse from Gate 1 or Gate 2. Variable for Speed, Duration, and Amount. LFO S&H: A combination LFO or S&H module, which uses variable waveforms as its modulation source. Both LFO and S&H clocks can be free-running or synced to the host tempo. As well as S&H the clock for the S&H module can be derived from Gate 1 or Gate 2 for more interesting rhythmic effects. Vibrato LFO: Used as a pitch modulation source for either or both of the 2 oscillators. Contains controls for Rate, Delay, Depth and can be triggered from note on or Gates 1 or 2. Modulation: Using a variable mix of Oscs 1 or 2 the Modulation unit provides Ring Modulation or Frequency modulation of the signal. It can be configured to enter the signal path either before or after the filter and can be volume controlled by virtue of the env button. Mixed in Post filter the Modulation unit can deliver some heavy distortion effects. Both Modulation pitch and Modulation volume are available in the Mod matrix. Envelopes 1 & 2: Used for filter or other modulation uses. Both envelopes can be triggered from note on or Gates 1 or 2. State Variable Filter: can be configured to run in parallel (2 x 12db/oct) mode or series (1 x 24db/oct) mode. Both filters are variable between Lo, Band or Hi pass modes. Gate Arrays 1 & 2: Can be used to provide 8 steps of rhythmic triggering. Gates 1 & 2 are available as triggers to many other YAVA2 modules. Sequencer grid 1 & 2: can be used as a modulation source to the Mod matrix. Able to be synced to host tempo, and used in free voltage or note steps with display of current note value. Modulation Matrix: An 8 x 9 matrix of sources and destinations to deliver a high degree of control over the finished sound. Glide controls: Provide not only glide between notes but also glissando (note stepped glide). BPM Delays: Twin BPM synced delays which can be tempo-locked to varying sub-divisions and spread across the stereo field. \n\n",

This means that if you set 50ms release in the limiter, it will actually yield with 150ms standard RT60 release time, but users of L1 should be familiar with it.\nStarting from version 2.0 W1 Limiter also contains adaptive release logic. The author tried to emulate Waves L2, however could only do this approximately. Also, unlike Waves, W1 allows changing release time while in adaptive mode.\nWaves IDR dithering is not emulated.\n",

It is designed to work with Plogue Bidule for live performance, but it can be used as a regular VST plugin as well. \nIt performs just like many hardware looper units on the market, but with a maximum loop time of 60 seconds. \nExperienced loopers will recognize \"endpoints\" mode - where you hit the record button to start recording, and again at the end of the loop. In the other 3 record modes, you determine the tempo before you play by entering it or tapping it in onscreen or with any MIDI foot controller. \nOnce the tempo is set you no longer have to worry about hitting the record button precisely on a downbeat. You can play along to the click track and turn recording on and off whenever you want. You can set the number of measures to loop using a program change or onscreen. In endpoints mode this means how many clicks the metronome will make during the loop. \nIf you are recording, hitting reset once will \"forget\" what you played for one pass of a loop - so if you hit a wrong note you don't have to start over. If it not recording or you hit the reset button twice it will completely reset. \nFeatures: \nCreate loops in real time. You can tap in a tempo or type it in...or sync to host. Generates a MIDI click track and sends VST Timeinfo to host. Can use a MIDI foot controller for hands free operation. Can decay loops for slowly evolving Robert Fripp type action. Can reverse loops, even on the instant you mark the loop ending. If you make a mistake you can \"undo\" the pass of the loop you were adding. Can have multiple instances synced together for multi-part loops. \n",

RVM is a proprietary algorithm developed to calculate the deformations, the vibrations and the acoustic response of surfaces and materials.\nImagine a big orchestra playing in a giant box built with thin metal sheets. As the panels are not very rigid, the box will vibrate according to the energy of music and produce an audible spectral deformation. RVM algorithm is able to simulate such deformations and vibrations and apply them to the original signal.\nKey Features: \n  Residual Vector Modulation (RVM) reverberation engine. Reverberation time : up to 20s. Improved reflections algorithms for more natural sounding. Surface parameters (Texture, Absorption, Reflection). Density control (from Flat to Extreme reverberation). Size, Bass, Dry and Wet quick access controls. Very easy to use and ultra functional interface with large LCD screen. All functions and controls are fully automatable. 64 hi-quality presets.\n\n",

    "description": "General Features: \nLoads WAV files. Supports MIDI CCs. Syncs to tempo. \nPseudograins is composed of 4 main components: \nMain Loop: \nForward/Reverse main loop sample playback. Slices - The number of divisions in the main loop. Each of these slices are represented in the sequencer. ADSR [enable/disable] - sends each slice thru an envelope. Speed Control [min/max] - controls the speed at which the main slices are played back. Negative values cause playback of main slices to reverse. \nSub Loop: \n It works just as above with the exception that it processes individual slices generated in the main loop. Setting a high sub slice value will cause a pseudo granular effect, as you are dividing a single slice into an a much smaller looping sub slice. You can use it to maintain pitch, but timestretch the hell out of a sample. Larger sub slice values can be used to create stutters or general repetitions here and there.  \nSequencer: \n The sequencer is HEX based (0-9,A-F) - you can arrange these slices in any order you want. You can juggle a drum loop, chop a vocal into prefuse 73 stutters. The sync mode and quantize will further effect how the sequencer steps thru the main loop slices.  There are 4 sequence lanes label A-D. You can trigger these live to switch sequences during playback.  [Sequencer Sync Modes]:  None - As soon as a slice is played, it moves to the next position in the sequencer. It will return to the beginning once all steps in the text string are exhausted. FreeRun - You are synced to host tempo, but it plays thru the list, returning to the beginning once all steps are exhausted. Locked - GlitchBitch is synced to host tempo, the number of step played is based on the Quantize (below). Quantize - determines the number of steps when syncing to host using FreeRun/Locked. 8 - will play 8 steps, synced to 1/8ths in the host. 16 - will play 16 steps, synced to 1/16ths in the host. 32 - will play 32 steps, synced to 1/32nds in the host. 64 - will play 64 steps, synced to 1/64ths in the host. \nSnapshots: \n Snapshots are used to recall all parameter settings instantly. This is how you begin making things a bit more musical, as you can switch parameters instantly to focus on different sounds.  \n",

    "description": "B-Decoder - Ambisonic Decoder is a 3rd order Ambisonic decoder.\nSpeaker Distance-Amplitude Compensation The ability to specify the individual speaker distance from the center of the listening area, allows decoding for speaker array configurations where the speakers are not equally distanced from the center of the listening area. With the currently available decoder plug-ins, if a speaker is moved away from the speaker array perimeter, the user must adjust the volume slider of the moved speaker to compensate for the volume change caused by the distance moved.\nThe plug-in allows the user to set the speaker's distance from the center only, and the volume is automatically adjusted by the plug-in. If the volume of a speaker reaches the maximum, and its distance setting is further increased, the volume will not be increased. Instead the volume for all the other channels will be decreased accordingly. This prevents amplifiers and speakers from distorting, while maintaining an accurately volume balanced speaker array.\nThe distance sliders have a range of 0 to 10 meters with the default being 5. While the distance sliders affect the volume sliders, the volumes sliders do not affect the distance sliders.\nFully Adjustable Order-Balance Per Speaker One way of implementing per-speaker order control, would be to add a slider for every speaker, with a range of zero to three. The slider would only be able to select values 0, 1, 2, or 3. If the user selected 2 for 2nd order then the variables for the third order processing of that channel would be set to zero. As a result processing would only include the channels of the zero, first, and second order of spherical harmonics.\nHowever a second approach, and the one which was implemented is to add four sliders for all individual speakers, that control the order balance of each speaker. The sliders control the percentage of the zeroth, first, second, and third base. The user can now control the orders on a per speaker basis.\nFeatures:\n Fully adjustable per-speaker azimuth, elevation, distance, amplitude, order balance. Global distance, amplitude, and order weighting. 0th, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order. 14 preset speaker array configurations. Up to 16 speakers. Speaker distance-amplitude compensation. 64 bit processing. \n",

    "description": "Bformat2Binaural - Ambisonic Binaural Decoder allows you to decode up to 1st order Ambisonics for playback over headphones.\nIn this plug-in, four speaker feeds are derived from an Ambisonic sound field, and those feeds are convolved with the corresponding HRTF for those speaker positions. The speaker positions are 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. Since the left and right ear HRTF are the same at 0 degrees, there is one less convolution required. Same applies for the rear 180 degree position, avoiding a total of two convolutions as opposed to eight required if the speakers were positioned at 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees.\nWhile this method requires less processing power, it does not 'seem' to provide as clear a sound field as when decoding speaker feeds with positions 45, 135, 225, and 315. More trials need to be done into this.\nEven though it uses the compact 128 tap HRTF set available from the MIT Media Lab instead of the full 512 tap set, it uses straight convolution as opposed to FFT convolution, and as a result is quite CPU intensive.\nSee B-Binaural for an extended version of this plug-in in Audio Unit format, using FFT convolution for faster processing.\nFeatures:\n 1st order.

A trigger can be any kind of percussive sound, both mono or stereo - it can be a.wav file or another VST instrument for example. \nFor each of the three generators you can choose left, right or left+right input - input can be both mono or stereo. A band pass filter allows you to select which frequency range of the audio source will be used for triggering, so you can separate hi, mid and low tones in the audio input, allowing you to isolate different trigger patterns from the same complex audio source. Groove Analogizer also features Pre-Listening, so that you can monitor which part of the source is selected as trigger. \nThe Sensitivity control allows you to select the loudest triggers filtered by the band pass - so that you may include ghost notes or avoid them. \nTrigger Controls for each generator: Left + Right input switch. Band fine and coarse frequency selection. Pre Listen option. Trigger LED. Sensitivity.  Sound Controls for each generator: Release time: amplitude and pitch envelope time. Bending: positive or negative pitch envelope amount. Offset : pitch base. Timbre: from pure tone to noise, with FM option, overtone mode.  Output Controls for each generator: Effect: send to internal stereo delay. Pan: stereo image. Volume: output level.  Master Controls: FM: global amount. Smooth: slope time for all envelopes. Delay effect controls. Dry: blend of the trigger signal (audio source). Master: output level of all three generators.  \n",

    "description": "Wahwactor is a voice-controlled wah-wah VST effect plug-in. The Wahwactor system controls a wah-wah transformation in real-time using the guitar player's voice, more precisely, using the performer's \"wa-wa\" utterances. \nWahwactor is a two-input and one-output system. Out of the two input tracks, one of the tracks may be considered a control rather than a proper input since it is the one in charge of driving the transformations to be applied to the audio signal. In the context of the Wahwactor, the audio signal is typically a guitar signal and the control signal is a voice saying \"wa-wa\". \nFirst, the voice signal is analyzed to pick up a meaningful descriptor that, after a simple conversion (shift, scale and smooth), is used as the centre frequency of the wah-wah filter, through which the guitar signal is sent to be mixed with the original. \nTo work in real-time, the Wahwactor uses a frame-by-frame algorithm (described by this diagram). The voice signal is sampled at 44100 Hz and analyzed using a 2100 sample Hamming window and a 2048 point Fast Fourier Transform. The guitar signal is sampled at 44100 Hz and filtered using 2100 sample length buffers. The algorithm uses a 1050 sample hop size so that we have a 50% overlap in synthesis. This overlap is necessary to smooth the filter phase frame to frame variations. \n",

It lets the user control drum synths, samplers, and effects with their voice, and focuses on percussive signals.\nSegregation of the vocal stream into three drums (Bass Drum, Snare Drum and Hi Hat) is achieved using machine learning techniques, so that the user has few tweaks to do to start to control the drums. Two segregation modes are available, the first uses a beat box model made with the recordings of beat-boxers and behaves well for microphone control, while the other tries to separate the incoming sounds (more intelligent but less predictable), and is more efficient for processing complex polyphonic recordings.\nThe system is implemented as a VST plug-in (Signal Analysis, Onset/Offset Detection, Vocal Hits Segregation) coded in C++ with CLAM Library for Audio and Music library. It works using a frame size of 1024 samples and is fast enough for real-time performance. \nNOTE: BillaBoop is currently only really suitable for use in the Plogue Bidule modular framework to control synthesizers, effects, and samplers and the download includes a Bidule layout. They plan to improve the compatibility with other plug-in hosts in the future. \n",

The pitch is determined by the speed of the scanning function. Pitch control is completely separate from the dynamic system control. Thus timbre and pitch are independent. This system can be looked upon as a dynamic wave table controlled by the performer.\"  \nThe dynamic-string is a mass-spring physical model which is shared by all the voices and users can directly interact with the string's evolution on the screen. Each voice has 2 scanning-oscillators and a chaotic LFO to add drift and life to the sound. \n",

Both consist of rich harmonic spectra which are filtered to provide desired overtones. Each possesses its own exponential decay envelopes for amplitude and filter, and its own ADSR envelope.\nThe output from these is then fed into a little black box—a complex setup of delay devices set relatively for each note that creates a complex comb-filtering effect. This stage shapes the sound, emphasizing desired frequencies and providing richer post-filter overtones, similar to the way an instrument's body will influence its sound.\nThere are three global effects: a cross delay, distortion, and a reverb.\n",

Snapshots-per-second control that can be changed on the fly, to increase or decrease the time resolution. At any time you can change the zoom ratio, without loosing frequency details for the signals which have already passed by. The zoomed screen can be scrolled while analyzing, to easily locate the frequency range of interest. Pause the visualization with the \"freeze\" control. Both in frozen or running mode, every time you click or drag within the sonogram area, frequency and amplitude rulers highlight the values corresponding to that point. Every palette can be shifted by simply dragging the dB ruler, to better contrast the right amplitude ranges. A mark button is provided to highlight interesting parts of the waveform for subsequent individuation. Every parameter supports host automation. \n",

    "description": "Within the scope of a student project under the supervision of Stefan Petrausch, Daniel Maaß programmed FTM String, with which it is now possible to test the algorithms for digital sound syntheses via physical modeling, developed at the laboratory, in practice. In doing so, a model of an oscillating string in terms of a partial differential equation was solved with the Functional Transformation Method (FTM). \n FTM String provides a simulation of an oscillating string which is excited at a certain point by plucking or striking. However, due to the generality of the string model, it is possible to simulate any kind of one-dimensional oscillating object with this plugin. This includes a number of string instruments, like guitars, basses, and the Cembalo, but also several percussion instruments, like the xylophone, the vibraphone, and chimes. The type of simulated instrument is determined alone by the physical parameters of the model, which can be adjusted both continuously variable and on the fly. Hence, the advantage of the plugin, and in consequence the advantage of the Functional Transformation Method (FTM), is more the variability and the flexibility of the synthesizer, rather than the exact reproduction of real instruments.\n",

This is done by slicing the sample into discrete audio events and each audio event is time stretched as needed. You have perfect control over the transients, the quantizing, etc. so any piece of audio can be blended into a composition, even if it's at a different tempo, pitch and groove.\nThe sample events in an audio sequence are not limited to the original sample. You can switch each sample event to play another sample, at another pitch, with another stretch factor. So, for example, you can replace the snares in a sample loop with one of the snares in your sample library, or with a different sound.\nMuLab 8 also supports high time stretch factors which let you make new sounds out of sample slices also within the MUX Modular synth and effect environment.\nMore on http://mutools.com\n{See video at top of page}\n",

It allows you to \"detect\" occurrences of percussive sounds in an audio stream and send out a MIDI event whenever that happens. \nIncoming (mono) audio is split up into different frequency bands using three tweakable filters. The signal in each of these bands is sent through an envelope follower. When the envelope reaches a specified threshold level, a MIDI note on message is generated. The trigger module has some built-in hysteresis and minimum inter onset time settings to avoid fast successive triggers due to noise on the envelope curves. Visual feedback of the filter and trigger settings is available. \n",

    "description": "Steroid Bouncer is a processor for \"dual-mono-stored-as-stereo\" audio data. \nIf you have ever needed to deal with audio samples of two mono tracks stored as stereo data, you will be familiar with the bother of having to split the stereo track into two mono tracks, and process each separately. Steroid Bouncer makes this task way simpler - it provides independent control for each channel of level, pan, EQ and a smooth overdrive.\nThe controls are split into two groups, to process the left and right channel of the input \"stereo\" data stream:\n Gain gives you level adjustment, the minimum setting actually mutes the channel. Pan lets you pan each channel independently, you also could use this on a normal stereo track to reduce the stereo separation. Invert lets you invert the phase or polarity of each channel independently. Next comes four EQ knobs for each channel: Bass, Mid Freq, Mids and Treble. These give you some basic EQ to adjust the tone of each channel. Finally the Drive knobs lets you add a smooth distortion to each channel. Steroid Bouncer uses a soft clipping algorithm called the sigmoid function. This produces the classic overdriven sound, but does not totally destroy the sonic detail of the incoming signal. In fact, at certain settings it has a distinct compressed character. Once again, at the minimum setting no clipping is done at all, it's a straight bypass. \nSteroid Bouncer's signal path does not follow the order suggested by the controls. The controls are laid out so that the ones you'd need to use most are all together on the left. The actual signal path is as follows:\n  Polarity flip (if selected) » EQ (can be bypassed) » Overdrive (can be bypassed) » Gain adjust » Panning control. \n",

    "description": "The Collective 8 Audio Unit Bundle consists of three Audio Units: F8-V2, Mod8 and Res8. All three share a similar amplitude modulation sequence configuration. The audio stream is copied into 8 identical streams and an amplitude modulation pattern can be applied to each stream. The amplitude modulation patterns can be drawn to any shape, with an-easy-to use editing environment that automatically appears when hovering over the patterns with a mouse. Each stream also has filters or effects applied to it individually. The streams are then mixed back together. \nThe plug-ins: \nF8-V2 has LFOs, which are applied to highpass, bandpass or lowpass filters. Res8 has a choice of a driven, nonlinear, multi-stage filter or formant filters that can be independently applied to each audio stream. Mod8 has a range of modulation effects like vibrato and ring modulation. It also has echo, reverb, sub-octave, and pitch shifting. \nThe result is up to 8 different effects running all at the same time, each with its own settings and amplitude sequences. This layering gives unlimited options to create incredibly interesting effects, from intricate and wild effects, to rich, textured reverb, echo, chorus-type effects. The Collective 8 Audio Units come with hundreds of presets. Amplitude modulation patterns can be copied and pasted within each AU or between them. \n",

The real-time waveform generators support a huge variety of internal manipulation.\n PropheSea also has multiple LFOs, Additive Harmonic Feedback support, and a global FX section for mutating and sweetening the sound. PropheSea's Dynamic Vector Control allows users to morph between the four waveform generators via their own hand, or through the use of computer automated vector sweeping. \n\n",

The R Phase parameter controls the phase of the right-channel LFO relative to the left. When R Phase is 0°, the two LFOs are synchronised. Changing the R Phase parameter causes the two LFOs to oscillate independently, which adds width to the sound.\nThe Mix parameter controls the mix of the original and delayed signals.\n",

A grain is just a very short section of the sound, shaped to avoid clicks.\nYou can specify the number and size of the grains taken from the incoming signal.

These specify the largest variation from the associated centre value, set by the Size, Pitch and Gain parameters.\nFor example, if Size is set to 35ms and SizeVar is set to 5ms, then the grain-size used will vary randomly from 30ms to 40ms. If all of the Var parameters are 0 then no randomization will be applied.\nThe Mix parameter allows the original and resynthesized sounds to be mixed together.\nThere is also a quality switch. High-quality mode adds filtering to minimize aliasing when changing the pitch of grains. It also uses improved interpolation. GGrain uses significantly more CPU power in high-quality mode.\n",

(If you don't know what that means, then you probably don't need it).\nSome CPUs employ techniques to extend the accuracy of floating-point calculations for very small numbers. These small numbers are called denormals.\nUnfortunately, calculations involving denormals can be very slow. This can drastically affect audio DSP performance. In most cases, these numbers are too small to be of any interest anyway.\nAdding noise to the signal path can sometimes prevent denormals from getting into subsequent calculations. Obviously, the noise-level used is so low that you cannot hear it.\nThe simplest way to configure GNormal is to place it before a suspect plug-in and set the Level parameter to maximum. Try each setting of the Type parameter to see if the problem goes away. When you have found a suitable noise-type, you can try lowering the Level.\n",

    "description": "GSnap is an auto-tune effect. It can be used subtly to correct the pitch of a vocal, or, with more extreme settings, to create a robot-voice effect.\nFor GSnap to work effectively, the input signal should be monophonic, at a good level and reasonably noise-free. For example, a clean, mono vocal recording, without excessive noise or reverb. Effect plug-ins should be placed after GSnap in the signal chain.\nGSnap starts off by detecting the pitch of the incoming audio. The Min Freq and Max Freq parameters help the pitch-detector by narrowing the range of frequencies it needs to consider. Also, the Gate parameter should be set so that the pitch-detector ignores background noise during \"silent\" passages.\nThe Speed parameter sets the number of wave repetitions required for positive pitch-detection. Lower values for Speed will allow faster pitch-detection, but will increase the chance of false detection. The default value should be fine in most cases.\nOnce a pitch has been determined, GSnap applies the specified pitch-correction. There are two modes of pitch correction: fixed scale and MIDI. Fixed scale correction has a fixed set of snap-notes, while MIDI correction is controlled in real time by MIDI data.\nThe Threshold parameter sets the largest pitch-shift that will be applied to the input. It defines a region around each snap-note that will be corrected to that note. The GUI shows the snap-notes and regions in effect at any time.\nThe pitch-detection and correction can be made to use a different reference frequency using the Calibrate parameter. This sets the frequency of A above middle C.\nAdditionally, GSnap will respond to pitch-bend and modulation MIDI messages to apply pitch-bend and vibrato. The Pitch Bend, Vibrato and Vib Speed parameters control these effects.\n",

    "description": "GMulti is a three-band compressor and stereo enhancer.\nFirst, the signal is split at user-defined frequencies into three bands. Each of these bands can then be compressed independently and have its stereo width altered before being mixed back together.\nThe compression of each band is specified in the usual manner with threshold, ratio, attack and release controls.\nThe GUI contains gain-reduction meters for each band, which have a resolution of 1dB per bar. There is also a before/after waveform display, which can display any of the three bands. The waveform display features a zoom control, which allows the display to be scaled for optimum viewing.\nThe stereo enhancement works by amplifying or diminishing the stereo information in each band. If you set a Width parameter to 0% then the associated band is collapsed to mono, which is often desirable for the bass band.\nThe Mix parameter allows the pre-compression signal to be mixed back into the output signal. You can use this to restore some of the dynamics of the original signal.\n",

Sync mode: \"BPM\" or \"Free\". Note subdivision selector. Y->Vol (Y value to Volume) button. Zero - X: Useful only in \"Grainy\" mode; this parameter is useful to avoid clicks, but if you want to go very fast you better untick this option, otherwise you'll hear an artifact in where the pitch transitions aren't smooth on very high frequencies. X and Y spring buttons: Enable disable spring release on them. Smooth knob: This smoothes out the X and Y values, high values result on slow response to quick movements, useful to make slow sweeps such as on one famous Daft Punk song.

Guzheng was originally a rather simple instrument with only five strings. After all the years of evolution, today's Guzheng has twenty-one strings and is still widely used in all kinds of Chinese music. \nChineeGuZheng Classic is superseded by ChineeGuZheng II, hence it is turned into freeware, and it is now equipped with QIN RV 2.0 engine, giving it more possibilities than before. \nEven though ChineeGuZheng Classic is much less expressive and less detailed than ChineeGuZheng II, ChineeGuZheng Classic has its own place. Other than the different sound character, one unique feature that sets ChineeGuZheng Classic apart from other GuZheng libraries is that it was performed using GuQin's techniques. This subtle yet distinctive difference makes ChineeGuZheng Classic one good collector's item. \nSystem requirements and specs: \n218 MB meticulously produced sample sets. Powered by the Windows native QIN RV 2.0 engine. Windows XP/VISTA/Windows 7/8. 1GB RAM. Works in VSTi compatible 32/64 bit hosts. All samples are recorded in 24 bit 96 kHz. \n",

Sensomusic describes Usine as a \"real\" musical instrument - flexible and powerful if you like to transform or resample the sound on stage (not only push the play button of your sequencer), improvise and create unusual effects.\nUsine is patch oriented sound software where you can add plug-ins and connect them without restriction. The main purpose of this program is to provide a real time analysis of an input signal and then react with, and modify plug-in parameters to produce the sound.\nFeatures:\nBuild modular sound processing: create patches with \"modules\" and connect them by virtual wires very simply. Analyse input or generated sound, for example pitch, peaks or dynamics, to create adaptive effects; modify any parameter in real time. Use the built-in virtual mixing table to mix the sound produced by different patches on each track (up to 16). Create huge, creative or stupid audio routing within the mixing table. For example, routing a patch output to another patch input, or create a virtual master effect send and return, etc. Manage 16 external audio sources (8 stereo) and apply different effects to any of them. Create flexible Surround or 5.1 projects: all audio tracks are 5.1 or 6.0. The output sound can routed to any of the 16 available outputs, depending on your sound card. Create inserts patches on any input / output channels. For example a master limiter or a master reverb. Complete VST processing: You can use any VST instrument or effect in patches and modify any VST Parameter in real time. Create a front-end simple interface. Complete MIDI automation: assign any Usine visual object to a MIDI controller very simply by using the MIDI-learn command. Complete integration of motorized external controllers. Complete MIDI input/output management, for VSTi instruments or external expanders. Load up to 256 patches in memory in a \"grid\" and activate them as you want in real time. Synchronize patches and VST plug-ins with a master tempo. Use unusual and absurd tempo from 0 to 10000000000. Record your creations directly on the hard disk in real time: separate tracks, inputs and outputs. All Usine functions are \"real-time\", and you can resample, modify, input sound on the fly. Save patches, complete workspaces, and configurations, for a very quick adaptation to different projects. Use any sample rate, depending on your ASIO sound card. Usine has a 32-bit floating point audio engine. \n",

ADSR envelopes provided for each oscillator (with visual feedback), as well as a global ADSR curve. Fine-tuning of oscillators allow for adjustment of frequencies within 0.1Hz. Mixer for oscillators provides easy way of controlling the presence of each wave. Per-oscillator white-noise generator. Per-oscillator phase control. \"Frequency Expander\" effect available for each oscillator. This effect will start the oscillator at a higher frequency and drop the frequency to the originally tuned value. The end result creates a realistic \"smack\" noise that can be used to generate a wide range of kicks. Compression effect with variable attack, release, threshold, and ratio parameters. Convenient preset manager allows for one-click saving and deletion of presets, as well as scrolling through preset banks. Quick on-screen help reference. \n",

Instead colour is displayed when you hit a key. There are 7 colour palettes included – 6 of which are based on the palettes by the aforementioned Father Castel and Rimington, as well as Alexander Scriabin (all obtained from here), while the seventh is a pastel 'scale' of ndc Plugs own devising. You can add your own palettes. The palettes can be changed while the plugin is running by using the left and right mouse buttons to scroll through them. \nThe plugin also has 2 'hidden' parameters, accessible via automation, which control the attack and delay values of the colour envelope. \nA good primer on colour organs and the idea of 'colour music' can be found here. \n",

If the balance is set to either side of 0.5, the signal bounces back and forth between the speakers.\n Tom Pong can be synced to the host sequencer, or delay times can be set by sample count. Feedback and output level are also adjustable.\n",

Each wave shaper can be contoured using a collection of available filters. Because there are two wave shapers, the first can be used to drive the second. You can use the independent contouring filters of the two wave shaper sections to precisely design the character of the distortion. \nThere are two parametric EQ sections. Each EQ has five filters: low shelf, high shelf and three peak/cut. The first EQ section can be used to contour the signal before the distortion stages. The second is applied after the distortion stages and can be used for emulating cabinet response or adjusting the presence of the distortion. \nThere is a two-second delay with adjustable depth, feedback and filtering. The delay is placed between the two stages of distortion. The formant section can be set to auto-filter or can be controlled with a MIDI expression pedal. There are 90 different formant filter morphing wahs or oscillations. \n",

Its wide range of gain (+/-40 dB per band) and bandwidth (.01 to 5 Octave) makes it very versatile. The three filters are linked together so that when you change the center frequency or the bandwidth, the three filter parameters are changed accordingly: you can change the entire equalizer characteristics with one single mouse click making any equalization task very easy and intuitive.\nThe graph shows the computed frequency response of the plug-in, so that you can exactly know how your signal is processed. This is not an approximated or \"ideal\" response curve based on the controls of the user interface, but the exact computed frequency response of the filter, which makes this plug-in a true WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) equalizer.\nMain Features:\nWYSIWYG 3-band semi-parametric equalizer. Filters designed after analog circuits. +-40 dB range on each band. Automatic gain compensation. No latency. Real time display of the frequency response. Native DSP code for optimal performance. Random preset generation: auto generate custom presets with one single click. 'Smooth Update Mechanism': real-time parameter modification with zipper-free parameter updates. Hear absolutely no 'click' when playing with parameters. Full automation support (all parameters can be automated, with smooth and continuous update). Any sample rate supported. DirectX version: supports 32-bits floating point as well as 16 / 8 bits PCM audio streams. \nTriple EQ supports \"Blue Cat's Skinning language\", allowing you to customize the plug-in to your own needs.\n",

Extensive MIDI support. \nHarmonic Content Morphing (HCM) Synthesis is based on a large and expandable repertoire of standard waves like saw or pulse as well as complex waves like multi waves, trumpets, organs, pads, pianos, and voice samples. These waves can be modified in real-time by, for example, transposing the wave by one or two octaves and adding it to the original wave, altering its harmonic structure, syncing, compressing or expanding the frequency domain of the spectrum, making the wave fat using only one oscillator by transforming each wave into a hyper-wave, selecting some cycles of a sample and moving through them over time (comparable to wave-table synthesis). Any modification of a wave can be modulated producing lively shimmery sounds. In total there are more than 14,000 different spectra available for combination and modulation.\n",

    "description": "PhaseDelayArray has three effect units chained together. \nThe first unit consists of a sequential array of vibrating (oscillating) reverberation sections. The oscillations can be tiny or huge. The reverb depth can be tiny or huge. The overall effect can be subtle or HUGE. And, it can create a pretty big range of sounds. The second section is a modulation effect. It takes the output of the PhaseDelays and whips it around, or up-and-down or back-and-forth. The final section is a feedback unit with the possibility of a lot of delay (up to 5 seconds). The mix section allows you to tap into all this strangeness in four different places. \n",

Generally though these are designed around the assumption that you're just using the computer to send and receive audio, and that your instruments are just fed into your computer's audio interface. If however your instrument is your computer, it's not really possible to get audio in and out of the Ninjam system in a convenient way.\nBy having the Ninjam client in a plug-in, it makes it very easy to combine Ninjam into your normal computer-based music setup.

Pulse width modulation per voice and coarse (4 octave range) and fine tuning adjustments. Oscillator Control  Dedicated LFO to control vibrato depth and pulse width modulation. Glide time setting and mod wheel vibrato depth control. Analog control for adding fat analogue-style detuning. Voice Control  Four voice modes (monophonic, polyphonic, unison and chord mode). Unison with 2, 6 or 12 voices. Chord mode with 5 user-definable intervals (plus root note) for building up complex chords to be triggered from a single key. 6 play modes for mono/unison/chord, for controlling when glide should be applied and when envelopes should be reset. Smart mode for handling successive presses of the same key, or Reset mode, where all envelopes and oscillators are reset for each note, for a punchier sound. Mixer  Independent levels for each oscillator. Noise and ring modulation (between oscillators B and C) can also be mixed in. An external input signal can be mixed in on the VST effect version (this is mixed into each voice). Amplitude Envelope  Classic ADSR envelope with velocity sensitivity. Optional 'Warm' VCA mode gives a non-linear analogue-style response. FX  Chorus modeled on the classic Roland Juno chorus, with depth and rate controls. Dual Filters  Two fat multimode Moog-style filters per voice, with 5 filter types (lowpass 12/24dB, bandpass 12/24dB and highpass 12dB). Filters can be overdriven and can be made to self-oscillate, just like true analogue filters. Keytrack, velocity and filter envelope can all be used to modulate the cutoff frequency. Optional 'Warm' mode drives filter harder to add more oomph and body. Filter Envelope  The classic ADSR envelope for modulating cutoff of the filters. Waveshaping  Optional waveshaper per voice with five different modes and drive control (goes up to 11). Transistor, diode, hard clip, sine and rectifier shaping modes. Routing  Waveshaper and the two filters can be configured in five different arrangements, including serial and parallel configurations, for flexibility. LFO  LFO with sine, triangle, square, positive-only square, sample and hold and noise shapes. Can modulate amplitude, oscillator pitch B, oscillator pitch C, filter A and filter B.

The second idea is to avoid sterile repetition of the same thing by including various random features. You can achieve subtle variations on a snare's pitch, a cymbal's decay, or simulate the osc pitch instability of an old analogue synth, but you can also turn your pattern into something totally different after each repetition. Livetweaker aims to keep things both simple, quick, and easy to use, all along with deep user customizable features for more sonic control.\n\n",

    "description": "NUCLEAR CRANIUM is a free Multi-Band Distortion/FSU device designed to aid in the construction of experimental music and sounds. \nNUCLEAR CRANIUM works by splitting the incoming source material using a Comb Filter into four frequency layers; Hi, Mid, Low, and Else. Then each frequency layer has its own proprietary FX units with which one alters or corrupts said frequency. Each frequency layer is then recombined into one unified new sound result. All frequency layers have PITCHSHIFTING, BITCRUSHING, WAVESHAPING, \"CRUNCH\", BITCRUSH, \"PSYCHODELAY\", and AUTOPAN FX units individually. As well as independent Wet/Dry settings and Volume/Amplification sliders as well. Each frequency layer can be turned ON or OFF to save CPU consumption. Nearly every single NUCLEAR CRANIUM parameter has its own individual internal completely reconfigurable LFO. NUCLEAR CRANIUM's GUI is 100% verbosely tool-tipped for ease of learning.\n\n",

    "description": "SQ8L is a software model of Ensoniq's classic 1980s synth SQ80. The SQ80 features 3 digital wavetable oscillators for each of its 8 voices which are fed through analog 4-pole lowpass filters (-24dB gain) with resonance. Sound parameters can be modulated by 4 envelopes, 3 LFOs and several MIDI sources. The SQ80 also has a predecessor, the ESQ1, which can do most of the same stuff.\n Although the technology may seem obsolete, these synths can produce a wide variety of interesting and extremely usable sounds. Thanks to the lo-fi oscillators and the analog components it can sound very digital and dirty, but also very analog and warm. Which is a good thing because modern synths often tend to sound rather clean. \n The SQ8L (\"L\" stands for \"Light\") is the free demo version of the forthcoming SQ8X (\"X\" for \"eXtended\"). Besides any bugs that will be fixed in the full version and planned features that won't find their way into the light version, there are only a few limitations:\n  Polyphony limited to 8 voices.  Program change messages ignored.  Common MIDI controllers (Master Volume, Pan,...) by default have no effect and must be programmed as modulators.  When used with a sequencer, the only sound the host can save within the song file is the one in the edit buffer. The full version will store the entire library (which makes sense when program change messages are used).  LFO humanization not implemented.  No Split/Layer to combine several sounds.  No internal sequencer (and there will never be one). \nThe full version SQ8X will have the following additional features:\n  Combinations of up to 4 single sounds.  Adjustable polyphony (far more than 8 voices).  New Filter algorithms with different modes (lowpass, bandpass, highpass).  2nd Filter and different routing modes for the filters: serial, parallel, split.  Improved GUI. \n",

    "description": "The EyesWeb open platform was originally conceived for supporting research on multi-modal expressive interfaces and multimedia interactive systems. EyesWeb has also been widely employed for designing and developing real-time dance, music, and multimedia applications.\nIt supports the user in experimenting computational models of non-verbal expressive communication and in mapping gestures from different modalities (e.g., human full-body movement, music) onto multimedia output (e.g., sound, music, visual media). It allows fast development and experiment cycles of interactive performance set-ups by including a visual programming language allowing mapping, at different levels, of movement and audio into integrated music, visual, and mobile scenery.\nEyesWeb has been designed with a special focus on the analysis and processing of expressive gesture in movement, MIDI, audio, and music signals.\nEyesWeb consists of a number of integrated hardware and software modules which can be easily interconnected and extended. The EyesWeb software includes a development environment and a set of libraries of reusable software components (blocks) which can be assembled by the user in a visual language to build patches as in common computer music languages inspired to analog synthesizers. A patch can be used as a module in a higher-level patch.\nEyesWeb includes a software Wizard enabling users to extend the system with new modules, data types, and libraries.\nThe software runs on Windows and is based on the Microsoft COM/DCOM standard. It supports Steinberg VST and ASIO, OSC (Open SoundControl), and FreeFrame plugins.\nAutomation support is provided. This let developers invoke EyesWeb from other languages, such as Microsoft Visual Basic. The execution of a patch can be controlled from external applications. Any scripting language that supports automation can be used for this purpose (e.g., Python, VBScript, JavaScript, etc.).\nModules include passive modules (e.g., filters) and active modules, e.g., sources and modules with an internal dynamics (i.e., modules which receive inputs as any other module but may send outputs asynchronously with respect to their inputs).\nEyesWeb libraries include:\nInput: support for frame grabbers (from webcams to professional videocameras), wireless on-body sensors (e.g., accelerometers), audio and MIDI input, serial, network, keyboard, mouse. Math and filters (e.g., operations with scalars and matrices). Imaging (processing and conversions of images). Sound and MIDI Libraries. Communication (e.g., MIDI, OSC, TCP/IP, serial, DCOM). Motion Analysis: motion trackers (e.g., feature tracking, tracking of multiple colored blobs), modules for extraction of global features from movement (e.g. amount of detected motion), analysis of the use of the space. Mapping of extracted features in real-time generation of audio and visual outputs. Output: visual, audio, MIDI, serial, network. \n",

    "description": "Brush Strokes is an audio-visual instrument with a drawing-based interface. Sound is generated in a manner similar to scanned synthesis, with two oscillators whose waveforms are obtained by scanning the x- and y-axis positions of the trail drawn by the user. The larger the gesture, the louder the sound, and vice-versa, when the mouse is not moving, no sound is generated.\nSending MIDI notes to it will change the pitch of the audio. If you click a mouse button, you will freeze the motion of the brush, and thus the waveforms for the two oscillators will also freeze. The position of the brush, and whether it's frozen, are both automatable parameters. As the only way to get sound out of the instrument is to move the brush, you won't be able to record or sequence it in quite the same way you would other VST instruments. Instead of straightforward MIDI data, you'll need to record your mouse movements as automation.\n",

    "description": "erratic 2 is a drum sample player with many randomising and velocity sensitive options to make any drum pattern sound different on each loop. It can be used to add realism or surrealism depending on how you want to set it up. At the core you have a 15 slot drum sampler with 6 velocity layers per slot, each layer can be played according to velocity, cycled (round-robin) or randomly triggered. To vary things up a bit you can determine the hit probability and hit repeat probability for each slot and add a random factor for the velocity, pan and swing for each hit.\nIn addition to the velocity layers, this update adds velocity-sensitive decay envelopes for volume & filter cut-off, as well as velocity sensitivity to pitch and filter cut-off. Another new feature is the hit repeat probability, with delay time, repeat velocity and velocity sensitive feedback. The step-sequencer is replaced by a more flexible MIDI / piano-roll triggering, which allows better management of note precision, long patterns and different time signatures. Improvements have been made to give 4 choke groups across all samples, better mute/solo options, sample reverse, sample normalisation, MIDI out, support for 32-bit wavs and more samples than ever before.\nFeatures:\nPlays any 16, 24 or 32-bit stereo / mono WAV files from RAM for low CPU. 15 sample slots, each triggered by user-definable MIDI note. 6 velocity layers per sample slot, can be selected by velocity, round-robin or random. 4 choke groups, each slot can be assigned to a group and be cut by a group. Per sample slot parameter modulation includes: Hit probability. Swing randomising. Hit repeat probability, with adjustable delay time, repeat velocity and velocity sensitive feedback. Velocity randomisation. Pan randomisation. Velocity sensitive pitch. Velocity sensitive volume decay envelope with adjustable contours. Low pass filter with velocity sensitive cut-off. Velocity sensitive cut-off decay envelope with adjustable contours.  MIDI out. Mute and solo for each sample slot. Sample reverse. Sample slot normalisation. Selectable mono/stereo and quality level for low RAM systems. Multi-out version has 15 stereo outputs for routing to individual mixer channels in your host. Single-out version available where host does not support multi-out plug-ins. 1480 samples (306 MB) covering velocity sampled acoustic kits, vintage electronic, glitch, jazz, world and esoteric noises. Over 40 presets covering various kits and technique examples. \n\n",

    "description": "Refuzznik is a distortion effect that applies a sinusoidal waveshaping function to its input signal(s). Sinusoidal distortion can be mixed with traditional shelving distortion. The relationship between input signal level and sinusoid frequency can be adjusted.\nIt has the following parameters:\n  ZeroX: ZeroX (short for \"add zero crossings\") is an on/off parameter that affects the shape of the sinusoid function. If ZeroX = \"No\", the sinusoid will map each input value to a value with the same sign (positive to positive, negative to negative). If ZeroX = \"Yes\", the sinusoid may map a positive value to a negative one and vice versa.  InGain: This parameter determines how much Refuzznik amplifies the input signal before applying the distortion function. An increase in amplification results in louder and/or more distorted sound.  FuncMix: The FuncMix parameter is used to set the mix of sinusoidal and shelving distortion. At FuncMix = 0%, only shelving distortion is used. At FuncMix = 100%, only sinusoidal distortion is used.  AmpMin: This parameter is used to set the minimum amplitude of the sinusoidal function. When the signal level of the input is zero, the amplitude of the sinusoid is equal to AmpMin. The sinusoid amplitude increases with the input signal level and will approach the maximum \"normal\" VST signal level (which is 1) when the input level exceeds that maximum.  FreqMin: This parameter is used to set the minimum frequency of the sinusoidal function. When the signal level of the input is zero, the frequency of the sinusoid is equal to FreqMin. An increase in frequency usually results in harsher, noisier sinusoidal distortion. NOTE: Sinusoid frequencies are specified as the number of periods/cycles the sinusoid will go through when the input signal level increases linearly from the minimum value (-1) to the maximum value (1).  FreqDif: The FreqDif parameter determines how much the frequency of the sinusoidal function will change when the input signal level goes from zero to the VST maximum. If FreqDif > 0, the frequency will increase with the input level; if FreqDif < 0, the frequency will decrease. \n",

In invert mode (hold down to play audio, release to mute). \nThe minimum and maximum volume can be set so that as well as muting, moot can act as a switch between a high and low volume. In addition there is an audio gate to chop the audio and a smooth control to add a small attack/decay between changes.\n\n",

It should be noted that the presence of the phase vocoder effects mean the plugin has a constant delay of 7680 samples, although PDC-capable hosts will compensate for this.\n",

It removes frequencies in any audio signal, while providing an additional creative purpose. Rubberfilter has a controllable filter order of 6 dB/Oct up to 384 dB/Oct. At high filter order levels, a psychoacoustic effect appears which is usually an unwanted sound of zips and sweeps, almost as if there is a tone present at the filter's cut-off frequency. Rubberfilter allows you to use this psychoacoustic effect for creative purposes.\nChristian Budde and, fellow KVR member, Dalor created Rubberfilter. The idea sprang from a KVR forum thread entitled million dollar scientific EQ? and now it has its own thread.\n",

This virtual tube amplifier processor is based on authentic models of 12AX7A vacuum tube preamps and tube power stages. While primarily intended for guitar amp modeling and direct recording of both electric guitar and bass, Studio Devil BVC excels wherever natural tube overdrive and distortion is needed. \nBritish Valve Custom features the basic controls of a guitar amp: GAIN, TONE, and DRIVE. It is based on the gain structure of popular British Valve (Tube) heads like those made by Marshall with some subtle modifications to give it slightly more gain. The dynamic response and tone is faithful to those from real vacuum tube amps and reacts to your playing style just like the real thing. \nFeatures: \nAccurate 12AX7A vacuum tube preamplifier stage emulation with DRIVE control. Gain structure signal path that's true to those on vintage tube amp schematics. Authentic Bass, Mids, Treble, and Presence TONE controls just like those on real tube amps. Push-pull tube power amplifier model with DRIVE control. FIR-based speaker/cabinet/mic modeling filter built in for a \"miked-up\" tone. 4X Up-Sampling Engine with 64-bit Internal Floating-Point Precision. 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz, and 196kHz sampling rate support. \n",

What is known is that it will take an audio input and spit out a modified signal.\nThe rhythmic, choppy, buffered and tempo sync output is especially pleasing on drums, but works for most instruments and vocals too. It has no controls, only a red LED display that runs from 000 to 099, each number would appear to change the algorithmic undertones that affect the things and stuff inside differently. Some of these so-called 'programs' appear to loop the effect, others don't. Sometimes the things are faster and the stuff slower, other times it's the opposite.\n\n",

    "description": "X-ISM can interpret inter-sample peaks, allowing engineers to make informed judgments about the resultant sound quality of the mix.\nThere is currently a trend in the in the audio industry known euphemistically as 'The loudness war' in which the engineering process is driven to produce a product which is as loud as is technically possible within the constraints of the medium. Debate rages as to whether this produces problems that degrade and distort the audio. One reason for this distortion is often blamed on the presence of 'inter-sample peaks', where signals that are usually missed by the Fs sampling of DAW meters, may actually exceed 0dBfs in reconstruction from digital to analogue domain in some Digital to Analogue Converters (DACs).\nX-ISM uses significant processing to provide a combination of up-sampling and filtering that mimics the operation of an oversampling DAC’s reconstruction process. The result is a meter that shows inter-sample errors and provides a useful tool that most DAW metering misses.\n",

Pulse width modulation, ring modulation and oscillator detune/sync are key ingredients in the signature sound. Throw in some pitch drift, bit drift, a sprinkle of dirt and randomisation and you have a wide range of lofi, chiptune, retro-tastic sounds at your disposal.\nbasic 65 was co-developed with sink, who also made the presets.\nFeatures:\n16, 8 or 6 bit sound quality. 3 oscs, each with their own ADSR envelope. Oscillators can be sync'd and ring modulated by each other. Pitch envelope modulation. Pitch wobble option, for subtle instability. 2 tempo-sync LFOs to modulate pitch, cut-off and pulse width. LFOs have attack/release curves. Tempo-sync arpeggiator. Flexible routing to state variable filter (LP, HP & BP). Envelopes can be reset or continuous at retrigger. Monophonic or polyphonic option.

    "description": "UpStereo is a simple, useful tool to make your mixes bigger, in stereo width and loudness.\nIt uses three basic basic systems:\n  A fixed frequency EQ designed to lift the highest audio frequencies, and boost the bass.   A stereo width unit, for expanding stereo sounds so they appear wider and fatter. At extreme levels other characteristics are also brought out of the sound, so this can also be used as a tonal control for individual instruments. This also has a mono setting, useful for squashing up those aggressive samples that take over the mix.  A loudness button that raises the waveform to the limits in a smooth curve. This saturation gives the mix a more perceived loudness, without clipping. \nThese stages create an overall loudness effect on the final output, so a gain control is included to keep the limits in check.\nThe main 'bubble' display on the plug-in is really a basic meter, when one of the stereo halves flash white, then the output is in danger of being clipped. Try and keep the levels so the white flashes only occasionally, this enables the loudness saturator to work at its best.\nFeatures:\n  Loudness control enables a complex saturator to boost your mixes.  Stereo width slider going from mono to wide, bringing the stereo image out and towards the listener.   Subtle Air & Bass boosters to lift and help the audio 'breath'.  Very low CPU usage. \n",

    "description": "Cobalt is a VSTi software synthesizer inspired by many of the digital synthesizers from the 1980s.\nIn the early 80s as digital technology became cheaper, many manufacturers designed synthesizers that combined earlier analog technology with newer digital technology. These were known as hybrid synthesizers. Well-known hybrid synthesizers are the Korg DW8000 and DW6000, the Ensoniq ESQ-1, and the Kawai K3.\nIn analog/digital hybrid synthesizers, the oscillators responsible for generating waveforms are digital while the filter section remains analog. This approach freed designers to use any kind of waveform; they were no longer restricted to traditional analog waveforms such as sawtooth, triangle, and pulse. However, by using an analog filter, these synthesizers retained the warmth earlier analog synthesizers were known for.\nThough Cobalt is a purely digital synthesizer, its overall architecture is very much like those early hybrid synthesizers. It features a wide selection of waveforms, most of which were resynthesized from actual hybrid synthesizers, while providing traditional subtractive synthesis capabilities for sculpting its sound.\nKey Features:\nGUI created by grymmjack. 26 waveforms - many of which were resynthesized from 80s hybrid synths. Flexible modulation routes. Apply PWM to any waveform. LFO delay. Polyphonic Portamento. Key tracked envelopes. Rich overdrive effect based on a custom algorithm. Stereo delay effect with MIDI synchable delay times. Easy to use. \n",

Pitch shifting is achieved with a dual head crossfading delay (ala Eltro Tempophon/Dennis Gabor/Pierre Schaeffer phonogene) and is decidedly low-? The saturating feedback also allows them to be great drone and noise generators.\nThe plugins are:\n++flipper - synchronized reverse delay. ++bubbler – a flexible and MIDI playable granular delay. ++pitchdelay - old school multitap delay-based pitch-shifting. ++delay – a fully featured 10 second delay, with extensive modulation and feedback filtering. \n",

    "description": "M-theory is a physical modeling hybrid synth that provides a very wide range of high quality synthetic and hybrid acoustic modeled sounds. M-theory is the successor to the popular String Theory and, in comparison to its predecessor, M-theory is far more flexible and delivers a much higher quality tone, with greater depth, clarity, and character.\nThe heart of M-theory is its multi part oscillator system, which allows the user to combine the output two exciters to drive a Karplus-Strong style delay based oscillator. The exciters can be either samples (24 built in, or user loaded), VA oscillators, or noise and each imparts some of its tone to the delay oscillator. Of special note is that even though M-theory can make use of samples it is definitely not a \"rompler\" since the actual sound of the sample is not retained; only certain characteristics of the tone are passed on to the overall sound. This method makes programming faster and easier while still providing physical modeling flexibility, and allows M-theory to have it's own unique voice rather than that of the sample.\nIn addition to is flexible multi-part oscillator system, M-theory also provides extensive filtering options (including the option of mixing low, band, high and all pass filters at the same time), dual programmable phrase arpeggiators, six built in effects, and much more. M-theory comes with 320 presets which range from sounds inspired by natural instruments all the way to other-worldly pads and ambiences.\nKey features:\nKarplus-Strong style synthesis engine. Dual exciters, each with the option of samples, VA or noise sources. Independent low, band, high, and all pass filters. Dual programmable arpeggiators and an extra MIDI note doubler. Built in tremolo, metal effect, chorus, delay, distortion, and reverb. 320 presets. \n\n",

Disturbance can be used to create subtle variations and effects, or it can warp your source material into something completely new.\nDisturbance is similar to a slicer, but a bit different. It works by chopping up a loop into 64 equal parts, then sequencing their playback, and each slice in Disturbance has its own loop point. In addition to offering several playback order options, Disturbance also offers sequenced filtering, distortion, pitch shifting, slice length adjustment, several types of playback randomizations, as well as loop point adjustment, dual delays, and non sequenced pitch shifting which can even be set to track MIDI note input, allowing you to turn anything you load into Disturbance into a playable synth oscillator. Additionally, you can even turn off the clock and use your modulation wheel (CC1) to move forwards and backwards through the loop, almost like a wavetable.\nSequencer related features:\nSlice length reduction. Filter cutoff (low or high pass filtering). Pitch shifting. Dirt (distortion + downsampling + filtering). Slice reverse. Random slice. 4 sequencer direction options. Mod wheel control over playback. Sequencer jitter effect. Host BPM sync or internal clock. Sequencer start/end point adjustment. \nAdditional features:\nBuilt in file browser. Dual Delay. Velocity sensitivity. Pitch Shifter with the option of fixed (non-sequenced) settings, MIDI note tracking, and portamento. 32 example/tutorial presets to get you started. \n\n",

    "description": "What is hypercyclic?:\nan LFO-driven MIDI arpeggiator, gate effect and step sequencer. for mangling sustained MIDI input chords. the output of which can then drive other MIDI instruments. acts either as a VST or Audio Unit plugin for your DAW, or as a standalone application. the original hypercyclic won 2nd place in the KVRAudio.com Developer Challenge '07. the sweetspot for hypercyclic is the narrow border between chaos and regularity. Or, in other words, how to induce a certain pleasant randomness and syncopation, yet forcing everything to align again on the bar or beat boundaries. \nHow do you use it?:\nthe main use for hypercyclic is to generate MIDI that can be recorded and/or sent to other plugins. However it also features a simple built-in synth for testing purposes. you can use two tempo-synced LFOs to modulate various parameters for creating interesting rhythmic effects and chord variations. a unique feature is the possiblity to modulate the sequencer step size itself, which is useful for creating glitchy stuttering effects. another thing you can use is a groove function for playing slightly off the beat. The groove parameters can also be modulated over time by the LFOs, adding to the rhythmic variation. \nNow with 64-bit support.\n\n",

    "description": "Fauna is a simple waveguide model of the vocal tract intended to provide a flexible platform for the synthesis of abstract and animal voices. \nWaveguide synthesis is a physical modeling technique that makes use of delay lines to model the transmission of acoustic vibrations. A sample rate of 44.1kHz translates to a distance of less than 1cm under normal atmospheric conditions, so modern computers can achieve a degree of accuracy in acoustic modeling. \nThe delay bore is divided into five sections. Reflection coefficients control the transmission between segments, which effectively emulate the area of the tract at each position. Kelly and Lochbaum developed this speech synthesis technique in 1962. \nUnlike conventional speech synthesizers, which use the tract to add formants to an oscillator, the fundamental pitch is determined by the overall form of the model. \nThe glottis acts like a reed, opening with air pressure from the lungs (determined by a pressure coefficient) and closing with air reflected back from the mouth. The position of the glottis is a result of these and other forces, such as tension and springiness of the muscle tissue. \nOscillation is produced by the balance of pressure waves in the tract and their effect on the glottis; as the size of the aperture changes, so do its properties of transmission and reflection. \nFauna VST uses four sets of five reflection coefficients to describe the shape of the vocal tract. Four 16-stage graphic envelopes and three dual-contour LFOs are applied to the tract coefficients. A bank of nine sends and two 'splits' route modulators to parameters as groups to assist in the emulation of organic forms. \nThe structure is not complex enough for speech, keeping in mind that the five coefficients describe the contour of the throat from the glottis and not from the back of the mouth. It may surprise you how many sounds it can create given the low waveguide count. \n\n",

It is intended for rhythmic and experimental applications and geared towards live use.\n Two separate counters are assignable to three gate and three modulation sequences. The counters are modulated by three LFOs, four random step modulators and several performance-oriented GUI controls.\n The architecture is flexible and adapts to many purposes. While not intended, it can be used as a powerful arpeggiator and presents an intuitive mapping of pitch cycling functions.\n The multi-trigger element from Circuit VSTi creates rhythmic articulations and can be controlled from the GUI or by modulators.\n Series VSTi expands on the architecture of MiniSeries, a freeware version with slightly different capabilities. \n\n",

    "description": "Zimple-Gate is a noise remover plug-in.\nA noise gate is generally used to remove unwanted noise or sounds from a recorded audio track. To operate the gate, you have to first set the Threshold level; any sounds on the track that have a an amplitude level below this threshold will be muted. Think about this as an actual gate that will close in front of any sound that is below this threshold and open for sounds louder than the threshold.\nIn addition, you will have to set the Release and Attack time. The Release determines how fast the gate will close once it detects sounds below the threshold, while the Attack determines how fast the gate will open once it detects louder sounds. Depending on the nature of the sound (more transient or with a smoother envelope), different Attack and and Release settings will be necessary to obtain a natural result; even an infinitesimal difference in the settings can make a noticeable difference on the sound.\n",

    "description": "CombOver is an FSU effect based on Comb Filters. Unlike a normal comb filter effect CombOver is trying too hard to cover up the naked pate of boring audio. Unlike those old FSU fx this one is understandable, programmable and doesn't explode with feedback. But similarly otherworldly, wet or electric, exploding or glitchy and twitching sounds are possible with CombOver.\nCombOver features delay times controlled by pitch detection and harmonic overtone series slider bank modulated by a step sequencer, a vector mixing X/Y pad top select amongst the delay times of four different harmonic-modulated delay times and a harmonic mix control to blend in harmonics with the root pitch-controlled comb filter. There are five comb filters in all.\nFeatures:\n  5 modulated comb filters.  Comb filter time modulation provided by input audio pitch detection.  16 graphical sliders to choose 16 harmonic overtones for modulation source.  16-step sequencer to modulate selected harmonic overtone for time modulation.  X/Y joystick-controlled vector mixer to blend between 4 harmonically-modulated comb filters.  A variety of tempo-synced beat division choices for the sequencer.  Stereo peak hold control on the pitch detector to ensure sensible pitch detection from stereo inputs, also acts as modulation smoothing envelope.  Pitch detection octave selection control. \n\n",

It can also be used as a phrase arpeggiator to make sure that you never play out of key or out of sequence.\n Hyperion's architecture is semi-modular, meaning that each component can be driven by a selection of other components precedent to it in the modulation hierarchy. Each component has a source that it counts, and a source that resets it, for instance a sequencer might count measures and be reset by MIDI NoteOn ('gate') events. The output is recallable, and translates between scales and tempos.\n\n",

The top puck controls the level of each effect bank, the bottom puck modulates any 4 of 13 parameters within the effect banks. This allows continuous morphing of the sound by moving the pucks to vary the impact of each effect bank.\nAs well as manually controlling each puck (either by mouse or MIDI controller) you can lock the pucks together and/or set them to move automatically, either randomly or by a configurable LFO, all in sync with your project tempo.\nFeatures:\n4 effect banks: Dirtifier – overdrive, bit crush, sample rate, variable state filter. Modulator – flanger, tempo sync LFO modulates auto-pan or ring mod. Delay – tempo sync delay with reverse, ping-pong and LP filter options. Granulator – tempo sync granulator, pitch shift and gate with random options.  2 independent XY pucks control: Effect bank wet/dry level and/or relative volume. Any 4 of 13 effect parameters.  Set the minimum levels of the pucks to change the sensitivity. Lock bottom puck to the top puck to control both with one movement. Either or both pucks can be independently set to 'auto', which moves the puck either randomly or by a configurable LFO, all in sync with host tempo. Seeded randomisation with option to loop. Switch unused effect banks off saves CPU. Master volume and wet/dry levels. Over 100 presets, from subtle to mental. All controls have MIDI CC's assigned with MIDI learn option. \n\n\n",

Output pan & mix controls. \nUses\nVoice Production: Use sideGATE as a lookahead noise-gate when, for example, you have a presenter speaking against background noise. Normal gating would result in a bump in background noise as the presenter speaks and the gate opens but with sideGATE's lookahead feature the background noise can be gently faded in before the presenter speaks creating a smoother, less objectionable, sound.\nMusic Production: When the sidechain is higher than the threshold the channel is audible, when lower it is gated - just the sort of functionality needed to gate a reverb according to the level of a snare drum, a synth according to a hi-hat, a bass according to a bass drum and so on.\nsideGATE can also be used to alter the attack of a sound (e.g. soften a solo electric guitar making it feel more like a lap steel) and its panned outputs can be used to create a situation where the position of a sound in the stereo field is switched according to its volume.\n\n",

Two waveguides are used to model the primary resonances of a physical object. The synthesis engine employs 4x oversampling, providing reasonable emulations of sounds produced by friction, such as squealing tires, squeaky hinges and wiping noises.\nModulation consists of three 32-stage envelopes (designed by Chris Kerry,) 4 configurable LFOs and an x-y pad. A group of sends allows modulators and controllers to be assigned to multiple destinations, similar to those used on xoxos' other physical models such as Fauna and Oscine Tract.\n\n",

    "description": "Sonic Visualiser is an application for viewing and analysing the contents of music audio files. The aim of Sonic Visualiser is to be the first program you reach for when want to study a musical recording rather than simply listen to it.\nAs well as a number of features designed to make exploring audio data as revealing as possible, Sonic Visualiser also has powerful annotation capabilities to help describe what you find, and the ability to run automated annotation and analysis plugins.\nFeatures include sophisticated spectrogram views; multi-resolution waveform and data displays; manual annotation of time points and curves; measurement capabilities from spectrogram and spectrum; playback at any speed; looping and playback of discontiguous selections; ability to apply standard audio effects and compare the results with their inputs; and support for onset detection, beat tracking, structural segmentation, key estimation and many other automated feature extraction algorithms via Vamp audio analysis plugins.\nSonic Visualiser contains features for the following:\nLoad audio files in WAV, Ogg and MP3 formats, and view their waveforms. Look at audio visualisations such as spectrogram views, with interactive adjustment of display parameters. Annotate audio data by adding labelled time points and defining segments, point values and curves. Overlay annotations on top of one another with aligned scales, and overlay annotations on top of waveform or spectrogram views. View the same data at multiple time resolutions simultaneously (for close-up and overview). Run feature-extraction plugins to calculate annotations automatically, using algorithms such as beat trackers, pitch detectors and so on. Import annotation layers from various text file formats. Import note data from MIDI files, view it alongside other frequency scales, and play it with the original audio. Play back the audio plus synthesised annotations, taking care to synchronise playback with display. Select areas of interest, optionally snapping to nearby feature locations, and audition individual and comparative selections in seamless loops. Time-stretch playback, slowing right down or speeding up to a tiny fraction or huge multiple of the original speed while retaining a synchronised display. Export audio regions and annotation layers to external files. \nThe design goals for Sonic Visualiser are:\nTo provide the best available core waveform and spectrogram audio visualisations for use with substantial files of music audio data. To facilitate ready comparisons between different kinds of data, for example by making it easy to overlay one set of data on another, or display the same data in more than one way at the same time. To be straightforward. The user interface should be simpler to learn and to explain than the internal data structures. In this respect, Sonic Visualiser aims to resemble a consumer audio application. To be responsive, slick, and enjoyable. Even if you have to wait for your results to be calculated, you should be able to do something else with the audio data while you wait. Sonic Visualiser is pervasively multithreaded, loves multiprocessor and multicore systems, and can make good use of fast processors with plenty of memory. To handle large data sets. The work Sonic Visualiser does is intrinsically processor-hungry and (often) memory-hungry, but the aim is to allow you to work with long audio files on machines with modest CPU and memory where reasonable. (Disk space is another matter. Sonic Visualiser eats that.). \n",

It is also the first in a series of Son Of A Pitch based plug-ins planned for release. Hotel S.O.A.P is a pitch \"effect\". It is not designed to provide pitch correction. \n Plus one octave to Minus one octave, a delay-based pitch bend effect, Hotel S.O.A.P can be used as a virtual whammy bar but can also perform more extreme pitch bend tasks. It features a dead zone so that the user may adjust the pitch response to suit their style. The reflex control alters H S.O.A.P's pitch increase rate. \n Features: \nDelay based pitch shifter. Pitch bend ranges from, plus one above root to, minus one below root. Mirror mode, both poles bend the pitch to the same distance e.g. One semitone pitches the audio up one on the positive pole and down one on the negative pole. Independent mode, both poles operate independent of each other. Normal mode displays pitch bend range in semitones, musical mode displays range in musical intervals e.g. 2nd min (minor) to 8th per (perfect). Musical also acts differently when in mirrored mode. Instead of mirroring semitone distance it mirrors relative (to root) note. Dead zone: The dead zone sets the point at which pitch shifting occurs. This allows the user to alter how far the pitch knob is turned before pitching kicks in. Reflex changes the time it takes the pitch to reach it's maximum state. The lower the reflex control is set the more responsive pitching becomes. Setting the reflex higher increases the time it takes to reach the defined pitch no matter how fast the pitch knob is turned. \n\n",

It can produce non-repeating or complex, structured feeling sequences automatically. The GUI is designed for applying performance variations in use.\n Each counter normally creates MIDI notes at a regular periodic interval after being reset. Counters can be used to reset other counters, so that modulating the selection of clocks and reset rates applied to each counter can produce complex variation in the output. LFOs can also be reset periodically for sequencing contour effects.\n Period Seq is appropriate for experimental applications and sequencing percussion.\n\n",

    "description": " Astralis Orgone is a \"Dual Sample\" based Synthesizer. It is the next generation of the Astralis Range and is highly optimized with great improvements in CPU use and especially load times. It is a rounded synth capable of sounds ranging from Trance Style Rhythms to Hard Leads and excels at Pads, Atmospheres and FX. Great care has been taken into developing a logical layout and many useful control features, such as double click resets and CTRL fine control adjustments. It comes with 128 presets and 150 samples, though you can add your own samples very easily. \n Astralis Orgone Lite is the free version of Astralis Orgone with a reduced feature set. It is free, fully functional and a feature packed synth in its own right. It includes 128 presets and the diversity of sound created from 25 samples demonstrates the power of the Astralis System. Great for creating atmospheric Pads/Ambience/FX as well as Trancegate, Modulated and Arpeggiated Rhythms. The synth is free to use but donations are always appreciated to support future developments. More details here. \n Astralis Orgone Main Features: \n2 Independent Synthesizer sections, each having: A Sampler which uses 16/24/32bit WAVS. 150 wavs included. Filter with Low Pass, Hi Pass, Notch, Band Pass, Peak A and Peak B modes cascadable up to 8 times. Volume, Pan, Octave, Semi and Fine Tune controls. Auto Leveling Drive. White Noise. FX Send. Lofi. Normalize. Velocity Sensitivity. GUI Volume Envelope with up to 32 stages and repeating range. Zone - Limit to a range of the keyboard. Pitch Bend Enable. Microtuner Enable. Glide. Filter Range Limit. Sample Reverse. Sample Loop Alternate Mode. Sample Loop Zero Crossing. GUI Wave Display and Overlay for visually editing Loop Points and Start Position. Unique Bank System for handling samples - Emulates a hardware Synth with Bank dropdown menu and a dropdown to select the sample from this bank. banks are simply folders of WAVs in the user selectable sample store location. Creating a bank is simply a case of creating a folder and putting some samples inside.  Refresh Files Rescans the hard drive to find newly added files without restarting the Synth.  Polyphonic Gate Sequencer / Trancegate 32 Note Sequencer with GUI buttons. 4 Modes - Forward, Reverse, Random and Alternate. Polarity mode for Synth 2's gate can play All Off Notes, or First Off Note following an On Note. Shift pattern left Right. Flip Pattern.

Gapper Up to 32 Step sequencer to control the Gapper Pattern. 4 Modes - Forward, Reverse, Random and Alternate. Release Time. Pulse Width. Attack Time. Mix Level. Shift pattern left or Right. Flip Pattern.  Low Frequency Oscillator 17 waveforms used through the Modulation Matrix.  BPM or Free Mode.  Fully Featured Arpeggiator/ Note Sequencer: 17 Different Modes (more to come). Latch Mode. Pulse Width. Note Sequencer Mode with up to 32 steps. Note Enabler for skipping steps in any ARP Mode. Range - Limit to a section of the Keyboard.  FX section: Parallel Routing Mode and all possible combinations of chained effects (127 modes). Reverb. Echo. Ring Modulator. Stereo BPM/Freeform Delay. Flanger. LFO based Filter with Low Pass, Hi Pass, Notch, Band Pass, Peak A and Peak B modes. Organic - Unique Delay Based effect. Compressor. 8 Band Graphic Equalizer.  Polyphonic BPM based Modulation Sequencer: Can be used via the Modulation Matrix. Has direct Pitch sends to each synth with many modes plus ability to send through the current Microtuner Patch. Keyboard Range - can be limited to a section of the Keyboard. Smooth Mode for creating legato or using as a virtual LFO. Secondary Raw Output via the Modulation Matrix. Shift pattern left or Right. Flip Pattern. GUI Slider Bars lockable to notes depending on selected mode.  Monophonic Modulation Sequencer: As above but mono and without the Pitch Sends.  32 Stage General Purpose Envelope Used via the Modulation Matrix.  Spread: Automatic Stereo randomization, switchable per Synth.  4 Octave Preview Keyboard: Can use Sticky Keys for easy hands free editing of patches. Can behave as a normal Keyboard. Animates all incoming MIDI data. Scroll Mode can be switched off in which case mouse left/right operates pitch bend, up/down the Mod Wheel. MIDI Reset (Panic). MIDI Retrigger - Retriggers any incoming MIDI notes.  Sophisticated Randomization System: A single Random Button is used to randomize all sections selected in the Randomization mixer. 30 Sections are selectable. FX has its own Randomize Button, will randomize only the selected Effects. Randomization has been carefully limited to the most useful setting to ensure more chance of a usable patch. Every control has its own min/max set to ensure a useful outcome. Additionally Local Randomizers are everywhere throughout the synth for each section.  Microtonal Tuner: Directly uses Scala Files. Uses the same bank/patch system as the Sample System, folders can simply be added to the user selected MT Patch location. Up to 127 Note Scales supported. Does not use MIDI to retune like many other systems which means that Pitch Bend can be used with MT patches. Octave Stretch for Acoustic Instrument Simulation. Root Offset Tuning. Hz Based Tuning. Has 4 Note Layout Modes to provide flexibility on how patches are used. Unused notes switchable between last note or Octave note. Switchable per Synth so for example Pythagorean tuning can be overlaid on the Equal Temperament for a harmonically interesting sound.  Default Settings: Most controls have an in built default setting, generally double clicking will reset to this value. Also each section has a Default Button. There is a Master Default Button which will set Most setting to the default patch. as a simple starting point.  Information Display: All controls display their current value when manually tweaked, usually in percentages.   \n\n",

Up to eight events are triggered at manually set phase positions and three columns of sliders are dedicated to modulating the position of each trigger by the LFOs.\n The immediate application would be for loose timing variation, or special effect sequences, like speeding up or slowing down, or for sequences with erratic timing. Some more subtle timing effects are possible, e.g. by scaling the effect of an LFO on each step (as pictured on the screenshot) the LFO will stretch and condense the beginning of the sequence elastically. LFOs may be synced to different host rates to create complex repeating patterns.\n Phase Seq is designed to run lightly on CPU to accommodate the use of multiple instances.\n\n",

It has almost infinite feedback time for many modes, and so is capable of producing rich and complex drones when used with a continuous sound source. It can also be used as a traditional reverb or echo suitable for any application.\nSoundScaper has a diverse range of sonic possibilities using 300 datasets of comb/allpass timings, each providing a different effect model. Each of these modes can then be set to one of 33 different Multipliers (Styles) which take it through tight comb based effects, to reverbs and finally echo banks. \nAs with all HGS plug-ins, instant gratification is built in with a randomization system that will always result in a unique and usable patch, plus randomizers for each individual section. The plugin was initially based on Freeverb, though has been expanded and highly optimized using SSE making it a lightweight plugin with a small CPU footprint.\nFeatures: \n 300 different Timing Models. Number of Combs switchable between 1 and 8. Number of All-passes switchable between 0 and 4. 33 Styles which multiply the selected Mode Timings by increasing amounts. Size - Sets the feedback level of the Effect. Width - Sets the Stereo Spread of the Effect. Damp - Sets how much the signal is damped. MIx - Sets level between Dry and Wet. Master Volume - Sets the Master Output Level. Randomizers - A master Randomize for complete Randomization as well as local randomizers. Default - Instantly sets the patch to its default parameters. Freeze - Will Freeze the output when clicked, Dry signals pass through. \n\n",

If you need a straightforward delay that doesn't overwhelm you with bells and whistles, this is the one for you.\nKey Features:\nLow CPU usage. Up to 1 second of delay. Independent left/right delay times. Pan delay for creating a \"ping-pong\" effect. Delay times can be synchronized to tempo. Feedback can be fed through a lowpass or highpass filter. \n",

    "description": "Rough Rider is a modern compressor with a bit of \"vintage\"-style bite and a uniquely warm sound. Perfect for adding compression effects to your drum buss, it also sounds great with synth bass, clean guitar, and backing vocals. Definitely not an all-purpose compressor, Rough Rider is at its best when used to add pump to rhythmic tracks. Of course, you can use it however you'd like. The Compressor Police aren't gonna come to your house and give you a citation. Slap it on a track and crank some knobs.\nThe front panel layout is done the same as many hardware compressors, so it will be immediately obvious how to use it. A brief overview of the controls:\nRatio: The ratio knob is logarithmic in operation. Completely anti-clockwise is 1:1, and completely clockwise is 1:1000. The 12 o'clock position is 1:10, so everything to the left of center is single digits, and everything to the right is \"atom bomb squish,\" essentially. Attack and Release: Audio Damage left off the actual time values, so you're gonna have to use your ears, like the he-men did it in times of myth. Meter: That honking big dial in the middle of the UI is the gain reduction meter. It basically shows how much compression is occurring. Sensitivity: usually called \"threshold\" now, but Audio Damage think \"sensitivity\" always made more sense. Turn to the right, you get more compression, essentially. Turn it all the way to the right, and you've got a distortion box, the sound of which is tuned by Ratio, Attack, and Release. Makeup: 30 dB of gain to compensate for the attenuation caused by the compressor. Active: From the front panel, this is simply an off/on switch, but if you automate it, strange things happen... MIDI Learn: Like all Audio Damage products, the VST version has MIDI Learn. Download any manual from the current product line for an explanation of how this works as it is common among all Audio Damage VST products. \n",

Although it specializes in soundscapes and atmospheres it can also be used as a general lightweight synth. The uniquely developed dual oscillator provides over 3,500 different waveforms which can be mixed in many flexible ways including FM.\nFeatures:\nDual Oscillator - The Oscillator provides 2 waveforms which can be mixed using one of the many modes which includes A+B, A-B, Various FM Modes, Dual Pitch, Split and Distorted. Filter - Cascadable up to 8 times and includes Low Passes, Hi Passes, Band Passes, Comb, Low Shelf, Hi Shelf and Peak. 32 Stage Envelopes - Capable of repeating sections; one envelope is for volume and the second is for the filter and general purpose, assigned via the modulation routing. Drive - Auto Volume Distortion LFO - Uniquely developed LFO with standard shapes, plus custom shapes with smooth control. SoundScaper - Comb / delay / reverb effect for creating interesting soundscapes. Flanger/Filter - Switchable between flanger and filter effect, LFO has over 300 predefined shapes with smooth control as well as standard shapes. FX Routing - 3 different paths available. Modulation Routing - Multiple options for assigning modulators to destinations. Stereo Spread - Allows setting a random value to the pan of each voice. \n\n",

Virtual Glass uses the Internet as the high-tech equivalent to the glass partition between engineer and musician. Its 3D design depicts a recording console and a \"virtual glass\" partition that functions as a video screen, so even the least tech-savvy user feels right at home using the plug-in for real time sessions. \nTo use Virtual Glass, you need a recording program, a high-speed Internet connection, a Web camera, and an eSession user account. Installation is simple, and there's no copy protection. The software works with any Mac-compatible Built-in, USB or FireWire camera for real-time video; the camera mic enables voice communication with the talent. \nYou can connect to other users and stream audio in real time from your RTAS, AU or VST host application to any other RTAS, AU or VST host over the Internet. You can use any Core Audio input device as a discrete talkback channel (for example web cam mic or your Mac's built-in mic). You can sync the connected machines via Rewire sync. This enables everyone around the world to collaborate in real time. \n",

When you turn it off and leave the tape loaded, the tape bends in proximity of the capstan, and this turns into a periodic pitch fall during echo playback; plus, it gets hot and the background hum gets worse over time... you should turn it off every now and then; the tape is never completely erased, and the capstan motor flutters... and it gets worse if you touch it while it's spinning; heads tend to get dirty very soon, in fact you should clean them often. This is true for the actual hardware unit, and for the digital simulation as well. \n",

It takes a mono input signal and generates a stereo signal with the original signal panned to one side and the ADT signal panned to the other. \nADT - Artificial Double Tracking The ADT technique was developed at Abbey Road Studios by engineers recording The Beatles in the 1960s. To free John Lennon from having to sing everything twice for real double tracking they came up with an artificial replacement: they sent the original signal to another tape machine and re-recorded it. Due to the physical distance between record and playback heads the new signal was delayed. The length of the delay depends on the tape speed (the slower the tape is running the longer it takes for the signal to travel from the record to the playback head). However, due to the machine's (small amounts of) Wow and Flutter the delay time was not fixed but varied slightly, giving an additional chorus-like effect. \nThe ADT plug-in takes a mono input signal and creates a stereo output. The original input signal will be output on one channel, the new ADT signal on the other. Blending the two is also possible. The plug-in allows to control the delay time (10 - 50ms), Wow and Flutter (both with intensity in % and frequency). All values are based on the technical data of the tape machines that was originally used to create this effect. \nControls: \nDelay: the time the ADT signal is delayed, 10 - 50 ms. Dra Level: the level of the original signal. ADT Level: the level of the ADT signal. ADT Pan: the pan position of the ADT signal, the original signal is positioned at the opposite side. Wow: amount of low frequency playback speed variation, 0 - 0.2%. WowFreq.: low frequency playback speed variation rate, 0 - 6Hz. Waveform: waveform of Wow, Sine or Triangle. Flutter: amount of high frequency playback speed variation, 0 - 0.2%. FlutFreq.: high frequency playback speed variation rate, 4 - 60Hz. Waveform: waveform of Flutter, Sine or Triangle. \n",

It can be placed between any MIDI input, such as keyboards, and any tool that can be controlled by MIDI messages (effects, samplers, hardware, software, etc.) It can also work without any input as a \"simple\" generator.\nZweeger is composed of various elements, such as LFO, envelopes, random curves, delays, note generators, etc. All of them can be chained in various ways, synchronized to the tempo.\nIf you are fed up with drawing automation curves, turning knobs repeatedly or if you need a third hand, Zweeger is the tool you need.\nKey features:\nPlug-in (VST, AU, LADSPA) or Standalone (for Windows, Linux, Mac). LFO, Envelopes. Delays. MIDI tools (filter, remapper, etc.). Internal and external triggering and re-triggering. Automation of most parameters. Synchronisable on tempo or on absolute timing. Fully controllable polyphonic piano, with automatic pitch bend corrections. \nZweeger is written in Java and can therefore run on any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6.0 or higher installed.\n",

    "description": "Erectifier works as a doubler, demented phaser or exciter. It is designed to widen and \"phatten\" your sound, although it is capable of being a very demented beast as well.\nYou have an LFO that controls how long back an echo is. You can set the length and speed of this LFO. Then there is a filter that can be LowPass, HighPass or Allpass, and a cut Hz so that you can control where the cut is. The distortion is to \"gritt\" up the sound a little, or a lot, it's not the world's best distortion. Then you can amplify the signal, if you want to. The filter can cut away a lot of the volume, that's why we have it. Then finally there is a on/off. There are two to the left side and two on the right side. And finally one dry through parameter. So if you'd like to test one of your settings, turn the other three off (via on/off parameter) and then tweak away. There are a few presets (plus a random-function).\nErectifier was programmed for Rusty Trombone by Shuriken.se.\n",

FMOD products are widely used in the games industry and have gained a strong reputation for its ease of use, powerful software-mixed architecture and comprehensive cross-platform support.\nFMOD supports many hardware platforms - including the latest 'next gen' consoles. FMOD is actively developed, with regular releases of new features. Many new requested features have been provided to customers in a very short turnaround - if you want a new feature, just ask.\nThe FMOD Ex sound system is an audio engine for game developers, multimedia developers, sound designers, musicians and audio engineers. FMOD Ex is intended to push the creative boundaries of audio implementation for games and the like, whilst using minimal resources and being fully scalable.\nDSP Software Architecture\nThe FMOD mixing architecture starts with an audio engine that uses floating point calculations with full 32-bit interpolation to provide maximum sound quality and headroom when summing signals. Using a node based architecture, FMOD Ex provides flexible routing, sub-mixing and output channel choices to the programmer. Input channels can be mapped to any output channel through a simple 2D matrix. Output to mono, stereo, 5.1, 7.1 and Dolby Pro Logic or Pro Logic 2 with ease.\nIncluded with the API is a whole suite of 14 DSP effects, such as echo, chorus, reverb, etc. which can be applied throughout the DSP mixing network.\nAdvanced Compressed Sample and Streaming Support\nFMOD Ex includes advanced support for compressed sample formats such as mp2, mp3, ADPCM and XMA. Compressed samples can be looped or sequenced with other samples, without gaps, clicks or other artifacts. Developers do not have to worry about anything to do with the destination format, FMOD's encoder will just handle it perfectly for you every time.\nAdvanced streaming engine supports low CPU overhead, multiple stream support, over-ridable file callbacks and more.\nFile Format Support\nFMOD supports a huge range of audio file formats including: wav, midi, mp3, XMA, ogg and mod just to name a few. You can even add your own codecs via FMOD Ex's plug-in support. FMOD Ex can play audio files with up to 16 channels.\nCreate realistic soundscapes\nSupply 3D positions for the sound source and listener and FMOD Ex will automatically apply volume, filtering, surround panning and Doppler effect to mono, stereo and even multichannel samples. Transition between calculated positioning and sound designer defined positioning using 2D/3D pan morphing. For even greater audio realism use FMOD Ex's:\nChoice between linear, logarithmic and custom rolloff curves. Custom geometry engine to add polygon scenes (FMOD Ex will factor in obstruction/occlusion). 3D reverbs to blend transitions between environments with different ambience. \nThe software mixer even has a 'HRTF' (Head-Related Transfer Function) mode to provide 3D realism through headphones.\nVirtual Voices\nVirtual voices to allow a game to play thousands of sounds at once on limited hardware without worrying about handling the logic to switch sounds off and on. FMOD Ex provides voice management using 3D distance and priority properties.\nPlatform Support\nFMOD Ex has a large range of supported hardware, including:\nWindows (32-bit and 64-bit). Macintosh (PPC and x86). Linux (32-bit and 64-bit). Sony PS2, PS3 and PSP. Microsoft Xbox and Xbox 360. Nintendo Gamecube and Wii. Solaris. \nFeature List:\n3D Sound Enhancements.

It includes: \nCC Value Limiter: Choose a CC to limit within a certain range.\nMulti Channel Key Range / Transpose.\nCC Controlled (or not) MIDI Transposer: It acts on any channel, and when on, any CC assigned to increase/decrease transpose will be filtered.\nCC Time Blocker: Some buggy MIDI controllers will send more than just a 127 and a 0 value when you don't want, this is to prevent any clandestine CC to get thru, which otherwise would ruin, for example, tempo tapping. When enabled, only one message of the CC you specify (and only the values 127 or 0 get thru) will be allowed within the defined time period.\nCC64 Emulator: Just a test tool, instead of sending the CC64 (sustain) out, it will filter it and mimic its effect with note on/offs.\nCC Inverter: Inverts a CC's value (i.e. if it's 127, it will become 0), this is aimed at inverted sustain pedals, some older controllers don't have the option to reverse the polarity.\nAftertouch To CC: Remaps aftertouch/channel pressure to the desired CC.\nMIDI Random Note Delay: introduces a configurable random delay on every note on message, up to 200ms (which is clearly too much). For example, to provoke slight timing drifts in layered instruments of a brass section.\nCC-Controlled Channel Switcher: Define an origin channel, a destination channel, and a CC to change the routing from original->dest. For that CC's value <= 64: originalChannel. For that CC's value > 64: originalChannel->destCh. Note: any MIDI message except note on's from the original channel will always be doubled into the destination channel as well, this is to prevent any surprises.\nVelocity-Controlled Channel Switcher: Instead of a CC, any velocity value above the specified trigger will change the note's channel. Except this difference, all the rest from above applies.\nVST Metronome: A very simple metronome for practicing purposes, outputs audio or MIDI \"ticks\" (configurable channel/notes), can be run synchronously or asynchronously with the host's tempo.\nChord Note-Channel-Switcher: J made this for making brass section chords. If you only play one note, the original channel will go thru unchanged. When 2 or 3 notes are played at the same time, the original channel will be routed to the ones defined for low/mid/high notes. \n Since in real life you'll never hit the two/three notes in the same exact instant, the algorithm calculates the lower / mid / higher notes each time a note on message is received, so if you have already pressed two keys and press the third one later, the ones that are not according to the new low/mid/high calculation will be \"noted-off\", the channel change will be made, and new note-ons will be sent again.\n",

    "description": " Black Magic is a unique loop workstation with the ability to generate diverse loops with a single mouse click. Furthermore a loop can instantly be recorded out to WAV, automatically named by BPM and timestamp. The idea developed to make sample based loops an easy and fun process, as loop creation is generally a time consuming process. \n Black Magic can also be used as a standard MIDI drum machine and also has the ability to jam with the individual sequences in real time. It has 10 Samplers each with its own sequencer and many adjustable parameters. It uses standard WAV files and ships with a large library of samples, but users can easily add their own. There is also an FX section which includes a Compressor/Limiter, Delay, SoundScaper, Flanger/Filter and Drive as well as many Modulation options including randomizers, a Modulation sequencer and an LFO. \n Black Magic looks deceptively simple on the surface and can be used easily without delving into the details too much, but underneath there is a vast amount of tweakable parameters. Each sampler has its own settings for 14 parameters such as Cutoff, Resonance, Volume, Pan, Pitch, Release, etc., but there are also a set of Master controls for these settings which are additive/subtractive. These knobs provide instant gratification and can change the sound dramatically as well as being automated (like most controls in BM). There is also an overview Mixer screen which allows seeing all levels for 12 of the Sampler parameters and allows a great way to randomize just the pitches or cutoff values for instance. \n Each Sampler has its own 32-step sequencer which can be triggered via MIDI and has adjustable step size, which allows for complex overlapping rhythms to be constructed. There is also a useful alternative to randomizing the sequence which uses a pre-defined set of presets which is randomly selected. This allows much more usable rhythms to be created as opposed to the standard randomizers (which are also available). Another useful feature is that Octave 4 and 5 of the MIDI controller affects a selectable parameter such as Master Pitch or Master Cutoff in real time which adds a whole new world of creative possibilities, for example playing a tune with the current loop. \n There is a Kit feature which allows grouping installed samples together and saving as a kit, this then allows quick selection of those samples in the future. The Kit screen provides a useful overview of all current samples where they can also be selected and randomized. Samples are stored in folders, and those folders appear as banks within Black Magic and there is the ability to lock the bank. So, for example, selecting Snare drums and locking the bank will mean that when randomizing only Snare Drums will be selected for this sampler slot. \n The FX Section has Soundscaper which is a diverse delay/reverb style effect, a Stereo BPM Delay, and a Flanger which can be switched to Filter instead, the LFO has a large amount of wave shapes available. Each sampler has its own set of sends for these effects. There is also a Compressor, Limiter and Noise Gate which happen just before the Master Volume Level, the compressor is great for a heavy compression sound that is popular these days. \n Black Magic Lite is the free little sister of Black Magic. Even though Lite has fewer features than the big version, all of the important ones have been retained, so it is a fully functional synth in its own right. Upgrading to the big version, you will get a large collection of included samples, the ability to use your own and a hard compressor, amongst many other things. \n\n",

    "description": "[update beta5m August 6th 2019]\n Public Beta, free to download, time limited at 15 minutes per session.\n- VST2 64-bit for Windows* (and soon also VST2 for Mac).\n- Brand new control for waveshape morphing.\n- Extra sound engine for the paraphonic mode (\"Paraphony\" on GUI) with new timbral characteristics, featuring \"analogue pulsed noise\" emulation.\n- The paraphonic mode allows very different articulations compared to the standard polyphonic mode (\"Polyphony\" on GUI).\n- As per above, \"Polyphony\" vs \"Paraphony\" is now not just a change of behaviour of the ADSR envelope.\n- Redesigned filters for the voice stops, especially for the ones labeled \"Brass\" and \"Horn\".\n- Recalibrated relative gains of all the voice stops.\n- \"Ensemble\" chorus DSP upgraded to higher order interpolation (improved transparency and warmth).\n- Rewritten \"Spring\" algorithm for Reverb, to allow longer resonances.\n- Reviewed all presets/patches.\n- Analogue Drum Kit: bonus feature: 20 of the best LoFi sounds from Drum Machines* of the late Seventies. (playable using the MIDI keys above the Strings sound range)\n- Minor changes in the GUI and other minor bugs fixed. Larger GUI also available. Three skins included. User can easily make custom skins by making PNG files.\n- Everything that was already good in 1.x has been kept. (Presets previously made for SDS 1.x needs to be adjusted when loaded in SDS 2.0)\n*Formats: 32-bit VST2 will be delivered on customer request. SDS AU for macOS will be produced after at least 100 requests.\n*Drum Machines samples from NUSofting DK+ Library. MIDI keys range: note 92 to 111. Volume controlled by MIDI Velocity. [note: this is just a bonus feature for SDS, if you are interested in a true Analogue Drum Set VST plugin to be release please let me know].\nSound --------: Note Number HiHat1--------: 92 [usually G#5 in pianoroll] Snare1--------: 93 KickDrum1-----: 94 Rim1----- ----: 95 Clave1--------: 96 CowBell1------: 97 Cymbal1-------: 98 Guiro1--------: 99 Bongo1--------: 100 Bongo2--------: 101 Conga1--------: 102 Maracas1------: 103 HiHat2--------: 104 Snare2--------: 105 KickDrum1-----: 106 Cymbal2-------: 107 Tom1----------: 108 Tom2----------: 109 Tom3----------: 110 Tom4----------: 111.\nThings you NEED to know to fully enjoy Strings Dream Synthesizer: 1) The ranges of the stops/registers, by checking the SDS help docs. 2) Cello and C.Bass voices are monophonic and can be played in legato at the same time of the polyphonic main voices. 3) A hidden bonus feature is the 20 sounds Analogue Drum Kit, playable with the top range MIDI notes.\nStrings Dream Synthesizer is able to reproduce the infinite array of rich, analogue pads from the most famous strings machines in synthesizer history - emulating the classic Eminent Solina as well as its sister keyboards from Elka, Crumar and even their Japanese cousins.\nStrings Dream Synthesizer does not use samples. Instead the \"octave divider\" circuitry typical of those early polyphonic synths has been natively emulated, so that all sounds are computed in realtime in true VA fashion.\nThe fundamental \"Ensemble\" effect (like the vintage Solina chorus) accurately follows the architecture of its hardware counterpart, including the BBD chip behaviour for truly rich modulation. However, it has been extended for a wider range of \"chorus\" effects.\nStrings Dream Synthesizer is easy to use. Its layout and features take their cue from and expand upon the familiar Solina design, with only the necessary controls to achieve the textures of the other strings machines.\nMain Features:\n \"True analogue sound\", VA \"Octave Divider\" emulation, (no samples used). 43 voices full polyphony, plus mono legato on bass section. Vintage audio effects on board. MIDI learn on every knob. 3 skins included. \nPlus:\n A full ADSR envelope generator and Waveform selection (for several strings and organs sounds). Volume fader and switch for each of 6 stops (C.Bass, Cello, Brass, Horn, Viola and Violin). The fader for each stop allows an almost infinite number of mixtures. A powerful parameter to tune the relative phase of Violin wave against the other voices. Brightness and highpass filters are also adjustable. More performance flexibility with MIDI velocity and polyphonic mode selectable. Note also that the C.Bass and Cello are monophonic with full legato mode and you can select one of eight keyboard split points, allowing you to layer the mono voices with the others. Chorus \"Ensemble\" effect with \"Bucket-brigade device\" tone. Four-stage Phaser for those famous \"Jarre pads\" and other Tangerine Dream sounds. Exclusive reverb with the ability to morph on request to that \"trembling\" sound of the vintage spring reverb units. \n",

This means that, instead of being able to try different polarities with ONE click of the mouse, you must open some random plug-in, hunt for the polarity switch, and then hit it.\nThe idea of the Flipper is to effectively add a polarity switch to any DAW mixer. If the Flipper is on, it's flipping polarity. If it's in Bypass, it's not.\nPreviously available only as a Pluggo plug-in, the free Flipper plug-in has been reissued in 2019 in native AAX, Audio Unit, and VST formats.\n",

    "description": "The Mid-Side Suite consists of two plug-ins: MS from LR (the encoder) and MS to LR (the decoder). \nThere are two primary uses for these: \nYou have recorded material using a mid-side microphone pair, and you want to decode this on playback into stereo. In this case, you would simply place the MS to LR plug-in on a stereo buss, and feed the L side of the buss the mid mic, and the R side of the buss the side mic. Use the stereo width knob on the MS to LR to determine the stereo spread. Alternately, you can use both these plug-ins to selectively process mid and side information from a standard stereo track. In this case, you would place MS from LR at the start of your effects chain. Then, insert other plug-ins, like compression or EQ, and set these to operate in multi-mono mode. This will give you independent control over the two channels. You can now, for example, apply compression to just the mid channel, or place a hi-pass filter on the side channel… or whatever other crazy stuff you wanna try. At the end of the effects chain, place a MS to LR plug-in, to bring the two channels back to LR stereo. If you don't want to affect the stereo spread, just leave the dial at 50/50, which is the default setting. \nMid-Side Suite uses the Pluggo standard, and requires installation of the free Pluggo Jr or Pluggo Runtime in order to function. \n\n",

The synthesizer is available to download for free (i.e. you don't need to buy the book to get the synth).\nThe synthesizer has been specifically designed to be a straightforward synthesizer with a limited set of features (one oscillator, one low-pass filter, one envelope to control the filter cut-off, and one envelope to control the volume). SynthWiz Simple Synth isn't a synthesizer you are likely to use everyday, instead it has two specific purposes:\n First, it is intended as a straightforward synthesizer for anyone looking to get to grip on subtractive synthesis and sound design basics. These principles are demonstrated with this synthesizer in Becoming a Synthesizer Wizard and they can then be applied to any synthesizer. Second, it is intended for people who want to develop an understanding about modular synthesizers and how to create synthesizers using SynthEdit (SynthWiz Simple Synth was built with SynthEdit and the underlying SynthEdit files are also available for free download). As you would expect, you are walked through the construction of the synthesizer in Becoming a Synthesizer Wizard. \nYou can read more about the book (and check out the introductory video) here.\n\n",

Create Dynamic (Pumping) reverb on drum sounds, unique sound effects (e.g. reversed voices, whiplash), and add massive depth and space to synth sounds. Includes both input and output stereo filters with modulation for moving effects, tempo-synced delay compensation, and threshold triggered-loop mode. MIDI-Learn assignable controls. \n\n",

You can of course load your own wavs (16-, 24- or 32-bit, mono or stereo).\nFeatures:\nLoad any 16-, 24- or 32-bit, mono or stereo wav file into the 4 loop slots. 445 MB of original drum loop content (295 loops) by sink covering many electronic genres (breakbeat, dubstep, drum & bass, electro, 8 bit, lofi, vintage, IDM, FSU and glitch). Tempo-sync each loop by setting length in beats, allowing stretching or different lengths if desired. Choose any number of slices per loop. Slix plays when triggered by any MIDI note, with volume envelope per loop for fades. 4 effects with independent parameters per loop: Reorder – plays slices out of sequence for variation per loop. Repeat – stutter effect by repeating slices. Reverse – play the slice backwards. Gate – add silent gaps into the loop.  Variation range to randomise probabilities. Normalise and mono options per loop. Stereo-out and Multi-out versions (slix and slix 4x4). Single loop version (slix one) for simpler applications or lower CPU. 57 presets covering a range of sounds and styles. \n\n",

Specializing in plucked or struck tones the Richman synths can also turn their hands to a great many other types of sounds. \nLike RichmanCM, RMXL has some special features including the fact that each sound generating 'line' is totally independent meaning that they can have their own portamento, Glide or Mono/poly settings. Some of Himalaya's patches show the mixed Mono & poly mode off to a very good advantage. Other improvements include Envelope modulation of the pre-filters and a much wider tuning range for line two.\n\n",

The best way to think of the difference between Ironhead and Ironhead:Spawn is that Ironhead is a drum kit and Ironhead:Spawn is a whole band.\nFeatures:\n13 plug-ins dedicated to unique percussive and melodic sounds. Morphing for each instrument, controlled by LFO, mod wheel, or automation. Minimalist vector based interface for fast, fun, easy sound adjustments. Instrument randomizers. Adjustable level of random tonal variations per-hit. Dual delays in each synth. Over 40 presets in each plug (over 540 presets in the bundle). \nAs an added bonus, just as with Ironhead, Ironhead:Spawn also comes with Tunguska... a morphing multi effect plug-in that includes a pitch shifting granulator, filter, envelop follower, distortion, downsampling, and delays.\n\n",

LinuxSampler itself usually runs as its own process in the background of the computer and usually does not show up anything on the screen, or at most it can be launched to show status information and debug messages in a console window.\nThat means LinuxSampler itself is the \"engine\" of the sampler, it is the software component which performs all the heavy and time critical computational tasks of handling MIDI events, calculating the audio data and sending the final audio data to your sound card (s). The dev team call LinuxSampler the \"sampler back-end\".\nObviously you need some way to control the sampler. That's where a 2nd application comes into game - a sampler front-end application. A front-end is (usually) a graphical application, visible on the screen, providing the user a set of e.g. menus, buttons, sliders, dials, etc. to allow the user to control the sampler in a convenient way. It merely sends the user requests to the sampler engine (LinuxSampler) and in turn shows the engine's status information on the screen. A front-end does not perform any signal processing tasks, so you can see it as a \"face\" of the sampler.\nTwo different front-ends / \"faces\" for LinuxSampler are provided:\nQSampler is a light-weight front-end written in C++, using straightforward native graphical controls of the underlying operating system. That way the appearance of QSampler on the screen is very fast and it consumes very little resources. Due to its utilization of the operating system's common GUI controls, it looks slightly different on every operating system (also dependent of the user's selected theme on his OS). Note however, QSampler does not fully support all features of the sampler engine (LinuxSampler), yet. Most notably the engine's instruments database feature is not yet covered by QSampler.\nJSampler is a full-fledged front-end for LinuxSampler, written in Java and currently comes in two flavors: JSampler \"Classic\" offers straightforward GUI controls whereas JSampler \"Fantasia\" provides a modern skin based user interface. JSampler supports all features currently available in the sampler engine (LinuxSampler). Also note that even though JSampler is written in Java and slightly more hungry regarding resources (compared to QSampler), this usually does not have any impact on the audio rendering performance of the sampler, since the engine runs completely independently and with much higher CPU priority than the front-end (s).\nFeatures:\nA detailed list of planned and implemented features is available here. \n",

    "description": "stWIP can be used pretty much anywhere you need compression, gating, distortion, EQ or limiting. Each Filter and EQ band delivers up to 30 decibels of cut or gain and the 10 cross mixed dynamics modes range from light compression to heavy companding. To top it off, a distortion unit can further boost (and / or destroy) your signal and a hard-limiter on the output keeps things under control.\nFully Specified: From a single mono input to a full 5.1 surround mix, stWIP automatically switches to the configuration of your choosing. Whenever a channel input falls silent the channel goes to sleep (reducing CPU use) and whenever a section is un-used it too enters sleep mode so you can use your precious CPU cycles on some other aspect of your project.\nIntuitive Control: As well as text-input of major settings, control elements respond to a set of [ + click] commands to quickly and easily set control positions, toggle individual sections, and copy and paste between patches. 5 keyboard layouts are supported for international users - QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ, DVORAK & COLEMAC - once set, stWIP remembers the layout so the control modifier keys are in the same position under the hand regardless of physical keyboard layout.\nClean and Simple: Each of stWIP's 22 main controls is colour coded according to the function it provides - purple for dynamics (gate & compressor), green for filters (high & low shelf), blue for EQ (3 bands, fully parametric) and red for output (distortion & gain). Whenever a control is changed the legend above or below the control shows a real-world value and whenever a section is toggled an easy-on-the-eye indication is given as both the knob's surround and the legend's background illuminate or dim to confirm the current state.\nVisual Feedback: As well as control names and values, stWIP's screen displays a waveform of either input or output featuring user-switchable update rates (6 scroll speeds ranging from super-slow to speedy-quick); whenever a filter or EQ setting changes the screen switches to display an approximation of stWIP's frequency response.\nMute Ability: Each and any of stWIP's channels (up to 6) can be individually muted (unless a channel is asleep) and the tall bright VU meters (input & output) give a clear indication of levels - expressed as either linear or non-linear scale (double-clicking the meters changes mode). When the input configuration changes the meters switch to show only the number of channels in use - for example, when using stWIP on a QUAD mix and panning the input to just the front pair of speakers, the VU meters reconfigure themselves to 2-channel mode giving a clearer view of only the channels currently in use.\nThere are 2 main versions of stWIP - stereo [stWIP (FULL)] and surround [stWIP (XL)]. They only differ in channel-count and price:\nstWIP (FULL) has 2 channels and can be used on mono or stereo tracks / groups / sends / busses. stWIP (XL) [the bigger brother] has 6 channels and can be used on mono, stereo, quad and surround parts - any combination up to 6 channels wide. \nIn addition, a 3rd version, stWIP (FREE), can be used on mono or stereo tracks but lacks MIDI and automation support. Despite the slight reduction in functionality (and nag-screen) it features the same algorithms and has the same look and feel.\n\n",

Low frequencies are mapped to high ones and high to low. The resulting sounds are highly inharmonic. You can try to set the min frequency very low (i.e. 100Hz) and the max frequency to its maximum thus letting the very low frequencies pass through while swapping the remaining frequencies... LEVELS: This plugin affects the spectral dynamic. It classifies the magnitudes in 3 regions: small, medium and big whose gains can be adjusted independently between [-20dB;+20dB]. Therefore by boosting or cutting the small magnitudes, you can either add liveliness or remove background noise. Just try it to hear how far you can change your sound's character. KONTRAST: This plugin also affects the spectral dynamic. It scales the spectral magnitude histogram according to a transfer function defined by the min, max and center parameters with saturation of the levels below the min and above the max. ROBOTIZER: This one just forces the phase to 0.0 thus removing life from your sound. No parameter except a gain. \n",

The modes are numbered from 1 to 18, the literals in parenthesis hint at the difference and can be interpreted as follows: \nHQR = High quality transfer function (ratio).

    "description": "Mothman 2000 is the commercial version of Justin Robert's  Mothman 1000.\nMothman 2000 combines 3 forms of synthesis to create a unique sounding and easy-to-use software synthesizer. There are two main oscillators, the first is a standard waveform generator that has sine, saw, ramp, triangle, pulse, white noise, and pink noise. The other is a phase distortion oscillator, a technology pioneered by Casio in the 1980s for their unique CZ series of synthesizers that contains two separate waveform generators that each produce saw, square, pulse, double sine, saw-pulse and three resonant waveforms. There are VCFs on each oscillator and VCF1 features a dedicated ADSR section.\nThe LFOs are actually LFO/HFOs, low and high frequency. The first is connected to the Amp section of OSC1 and the second to the pitch of OSC2. At low oscillation settings they can be use for traditional LFO FX, yet at HFO settings they function as FM operators that can totally change the sound. Using this combination of FM synthesis over top of PD and Analog-style subtractive synthesis makes for some truly unique yet still musical and usable sounds.\nJustin says that the logical and intuitive design make it very simple to program even if you don't know a lot about synthesis. There are also ASDR envelope generator sections for each oscillators output that can allow you to create everything from huge warm pads to more staccato brass and piano sounds.\nUpgrades from Mothman 1000 include a stereo digital delay, velocity sensitivity, slick brushed metal skin, improved performance, 64 patch memory slots with 32 added user memory slots, as well as new presets.\nMothman 2000 features 32 built-in presets with 32 user slots for creating your own patches.\n\n",

Your on-going music project remains private, having its own tempo, other VST instruments and FX, etc., in other words having its own unique musical character, while at the same time everything you do in this plug-in is by principle public. The plug-in connects directly to the synmergic server where the musical patterns exist and allows you to edit them as part of your project. Changes made to these patterns are directly reflected to anyone who uses them in their own project. \nAlthough the musical patterns are shared among various projects, this plug-in is not about sharing static audio loops or bits of music, but instead it is about interaction and joining the creative process of others. The various projects sharing musical patterns form a network of on-going musical creations. \nSynmergic Loop Editor features a polyphonic FM generator with the extra ability of generating various noises or even re-sampling real time audio input. This way it can generate from very simple single oscillator sounds to various noises with internal complexity. Each audio event in a musical pattern has its own set of FM parameters and a dedicated envelop so the Synmergic VST plug-in is a versatile tool for creating audio loops. \nYou can save snapshots of a creative session while you work on it and load the snapshot later into your projects using the complementary playback plug-in. You can create sets of up to 16 snapshots and activate them on the fly while you are playing back your project. You can not however edit a snapshot file after it is created or saved. You can only edit a pattern while you are joined in the corresponding creative session. \n\n",

    "description": "GTX is a vintage style 'character' compressor, designed like its muscle car name-sake for brute power, pure speed and to make a loud noise. It has everything you'd expect in a thorough-bred compressor, but is tuned for maximum control and ease of use, with its own unique vintage colouring on top, according to de la Mancha.\nGTX is an RMS compressor, similar to GTO but customised with a smoother RMS delivery and further refinement in the shape of a knee control. It features super-fast attack and release times and has a wide range of threshold, ratio and output boost, so it can cover everything from subtle correction to death-by-compression, with everything in between. With an external sidechain, wet/dry mix for NY compression and a hard limiter too, de la Mancha says \"you can really push this baby to get pumping bass and block-rockin' beats\".

It's possible to saturate / distort the input signal by raising the input volume with the input control (only if you use a filter as modulation type). It's also possible to modulate the panorama or volume of an incoming signal. This can be used for tremolo or trance gate effects. Panorama modulation maybe is useful to pan your percussion, hats or sound effects in the stereo room for more interesting rhythms and sounds.\nFeatures:\nCreate host / beat synced modulations. Easy to use graphical editor (double click deletes points, a click adds one). 4x oversampled TAL-NoiseMaker filters.

Also built in is a microtuning random generator which generates for every drum beat a tiny difference mainly on pitch but also on other parameters to generate a more sensitive pseudo-realistic sound. A patch random button is included to help in creative crisis. \n\n",
